[音乐响起--字幕精校中--By Persisan]
[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:48,804 --> 00:00:51,460
DAVID J. MALAN：好的，这是CS50。
DAVID J. MALAN: All right, this is CS50.

3
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,620
这不是CS50的典型一周。
And this is not a typical week of CS50.

4
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:57,399
确实，我们正处于2020年秋季的周三
Indeed, we're midweek here in the fall of 2020

5
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:00,339
在校园里，通常是一年级的家庭
here on campus, which would normally be first year family

6
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,942
周末，给父母和家人一个机会
weekend, an opportunity for the parents and family members

7
00:01:02,942 --> 00:01:05,650
哈佛这所大学的本科生实际上是来校园的，
of the undergraduates here at Harvard to actually come to campus,

8
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:10,300
坐在课堂上，参加讲座，并就地了解他们的学生
sit in on classes, attend talks, and get to know their students in situ

9
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:11,499
就在校园里
here right on campus.

10
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,169
当然，这一年，我们所有人
Of course, this particular year, all of us

11
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,960
除了我们以外的人，都以数字方式停留在遥远的地方
are staying afar, digitally, except those of us

12
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:20,559
实际上已经住在剑桥的人了。
who are actually here living in Cambridge itself already.

13
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,800
因此，我们认为我们今年会做的是一次虚拟的演讲，
And so what we thought we would do this year is hold a virtual talk of sorts,

14
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:27,099
围绕一个不需要主题的虚拟讨论
a virtual discussion focused on one topic that doesn't require

15
00:01:27,099 --> 00:01:29,469
对计算机科学有任何先前的了解，
any prior familiarity with computer science,

16
00:01:29,469 --> 00:01:32,019
不需要您进入或已被带走
does not require that you be in or have taken

17
00:01:32,019 --> 00:01:35,349
CS50本身，因为它涉及的主题至少部分是
CS50 itself because it's about a topic that's at least in part

18
00:01:35,349 --> 00:01:36,969
我们所有人都熟悉。
familiar to all of us.

19
00:01:36,969 --> 00:01:40,269
即使在技术上不那么熟悉，
Even if it's a little bit less familiar technically,

20
00:01:40,269 --> 00:01:43,179
作为技术用户，我们所有人当然都很熟悉。
it's certainly familiar to all of us as users of technology.

21
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,702
那个话题就是安全性或网络安全性。
And that topic is security or cybersecurity.

22
00:01:45,701 --> 00:01:47,409
今天我们建议的是
And what we propose today is that we have

23
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:51,069
关于如何保持自己的计算机的讨论-
a discussion about how you might go about keeping your own computer-- be

24
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:53,679
它是笔记本电脑，台式机还是您自己的手机，
it a laptop or desktop or your own phone, which

25
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,530
也是一种安全的计算机。
is also a form of computer-- secure.

26
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,140
我敢说这个话题，即使我们
And I daresay that this topic, even though we'll

27
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,080
了解它意味着什么的一些技术细节，
get into some of the technicalities of what it means to be secure,

28
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,519
我们所有人都在考虑或遇到良好的安全感，因此很熟悉
is familiar in the sense that all of us think about or encounter good security

29
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:08,769
以及现实世界中每天的安全问题。
and bad security in the real world every day.

30
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,860
考虑一下您居住的房屋，无论是房屋还是公寓
Think about the home that you live in, be it a house or an apartment

31
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,750
或宿舍或其他地方。
or a dormitory or somewhere else.

32
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,189
通常，您会在门上放一些东西，例如锁。
Typically, you'll have things, like, locks on the doors.

33
00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:18,189
根据您的居住地，您甚至可能
And you might even, depending on where you live,

34
00:02:18,189 --> 00:02:20,659
在窗户上有酒吧等。
have bars on the windows and the like.

35
00:02:20,659 --> 00:02:24,996
但通常情况下，安全的体现在不同的级别。
But typically, there are manifestations of security at different levels.

36
00:02:24,997 --> 00:02:26,080
我的意思是从字面上看。
And I mean that literally.

37
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,450
例如，在一个典型的城市中，可能会有酒吧
For instance, in a typical city, there might be bars

38
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:32,739
在一楼的窗户上，但不在二楼或三楼。
on the first floor windows, but not on the second floor or the third floor.

39
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,410
这就是说，有人可以从技术上
And that is to say that someone could technically

40
00:02:35,409 --> 00:02:38,734
通过二楼或三楼进入您的家，
make their way into your home by way of the second floor or the third floor,

41
00:02:38,735 --> 00:02:41,860
但这当然会更加困难，因为他们需要梯子。
but it's going to be more difficult, of course, because they need a ladder.

42
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,600
他们需要其他形式的物理访问
They need some other form of physical access

43
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,279
达到这样的高度，此时，他们可能
to a height like that, at which point, they're probably

44
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,660
将吸引更多的关注。
going to attract more attention.

45
00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:50,259
因此，对手的概率是
And so the probability that an adversary is

46
00:02:50,259 --> 00:02:53,019
鉴于他们会闯入你的家
going to break into your home given that they

47
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,410
必须实际上升到该水平并到达一楼以上
have to actually rise to that level and get above the first floor

48
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:58,149
可能相对较低。
is probably relatively low.

49
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,025
不是零
It's not zero.

50
00:02:59,025 --> 00:03:01,900
从技术上讲，没有什么可以阻止某人提起梯子的
There's nothing stopping someone technically from pulling up a ladder

51
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,290
然后进入那个开着的窗户或没有障碍的灯。
and going into that open window or the light that has no bars.

52
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:06,489
但是可能性较小。
But it's less likely.

53
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:10,060
这实际上是思考数字世界中安全性的好方法
And that's actually a good way to think about security in the digital world

54
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,660
同样，确实没有安全性之类的东西。
as well, that there's really no such thing as secure.

55
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:16,299
就像，您的手机从根本上来说并不安全。
Like, your phone is not secure fundamentally.

56
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,380
您的笔记本电脑和台式机从根本上来说并不安全。
Your laptop, your desktop is not secure fundamentally.

57
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:22,089
在某种程度上是安全的。
It's secure to some extent.

58
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:26,530
对于某些攻击或某些类型的对手，它可能是安全的
It might be secure against certain attacks or certain types of adversaries

59
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,360
或拥有一定资源的对手。
or adversaries with certain amounts of resources.

60
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,490
这些资源可能是时间，可能是金钱，可能是精通技术。
And those resources might be time, might be money, might be technical savvy.

61
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,440
但这确实是一个折衷。
But it really is going to be a trade-off.

62
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:39,519
因此，虽然有些不幸，但是一种考虑安全性的方法
And so while a bit unfortunate, one way of thinking about security

63
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,760
是您绝对不想成为安全的人。
is that you don't want to be a secure in an absolute sense.

64
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:46,749
在现实世界中，您希望比邻居的房子更安全，
In the real world, you want to be more secure than your neighbor's house,

65
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,689
例如。
for instance.

66
00:03:47,689 --> 00:03:52,029
您想以某种方式从物理上或隐喻上提高标准，
You want to somehow raise the bar, either physically or metaphorically,

67
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,150
对手，这样它也将把那个对手也带走
to the adversary so that it's going to take that adversary just too

68
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:59,230
太多的时间，太多的钱，太多的精力闯入你的家
much time, too much money too much effort to break into your home

69
00:03:59,229 --> 00:04:01,809
他们不如直接去隔壁。
that they might as well just go next door instead.

70
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:04,720
在计算机世界中同样如此。
And the same is going to be true in the world of computers.

71
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,079
但是我们要衡量系统的安全性
But we're going to measure the security of systems

72
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,870
更多的是计算，而不是物理上的更多。
more computationally, not so much physically.

73
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:15,560
因此，让我邀请您在屏幕上的此处打开此URL。
So with that said, let me invite you to open up this URL here on your screen.

74
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,579
如果您使用的是笔记本电脑或台式机，请继续将其打开
If you're using a laptop or desktop, go ahead and just open it up

75
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:20,560
在另一个浏览器的单独标签中。
in a separate tab in another browser.

76
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,900
如果您在通话中，可以来回切换
If you're on your phone, you can go back and forth

77
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:25,959
最有可能在两个窗口之间切换，具体取决于您的操作系统。
between two windows most likely, depending on your operating system.

78
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:28,417
但是，如果有时间，请继续打开此URL。
But go ahead, when you have a moment, and open up this URL.

79
00:04:28,418 --> 00:04:31,390
我们将使用此URL提出一些互动问题
And we'll use this URL to ask a few interactive questions

80
00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:33,579
您可以进行数字响应。
that you can respond to digitally.

81
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:37,849
我们还将在今天整个过程中也提出问题和意见。
And we'll also take questions and comments throughout today as well.

82
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:41,110
这么说，那么安全是什么意思呢？
So with that said, what does it mean to be secure, then?

83
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,090
让我们对此进行一些思考。
Let's take a couple of thoughts on this.

84
00:04:43,089 --> 00:04:46,689
您如何看待“安全”一词的含义
What do you think of the word "secure" as meaning

85
00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:50,949
在您的电话，您的计算机，您的家中？
in the context of your phone, of your computer, of your home?

86
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:52,389
随心所欲地解释。
Interpret as you will.

87
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:57,249
您会说安全是什么意思？
What does it mean to be secure, would you say?

88
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:01,599
放大中有数字手吗？
Any digital hands in Zoom?

89
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,340
如果您感到害羞，请随时发出提示音
If you're feeling shy, feel free to chime

90
00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:05,889
通过聊天进入，Brian可以代理。
in via the chat and Brian can proxy.

91
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,219
但是，否则，请随意抬起虚拟的手
But otherwise, do feel free to raise your hand virtually

92
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:12,550
如果您想提供您的定义。
if you would like to offer your definition.

93
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:16,210
是的，如果我说对了，那Pranav呢？
Yeah, how about over to Pranav, if I'm pronouncing it right?

94
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:17,939
安全是什么意思？
What does it mean to be secure?

95
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:21,789
普拉纳夫：是的，我认为这意味着，出于安全考虑，
PRANAV: Yeah, I think it means, by security,

96
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:28,945
您的意思是保护存储在特定系统上的所有数据
you mean to protect all the data that's stored on a particular system

97
00:05:28,944 --> 00:05:31,089
如果我们在谈论技术。
if we're talking about technology.

98
00:05:31,089 --> 00:05:37,359
至少要加倍努力，让自己有足够的时间
And at least make it hard and buy yourself enough time

99
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:44,000
当前某个人可能无法入侵您的系统
that a certain person may not hack into your system at the current moment

100
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,500
因为 -
because--

101
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,185
DAVID J. MALAN：很好。
DAVID J. MALAN: Good.

102
00:05:45,185 --> 00:05:46,240
普拉纳夫：-让我们面对现实吧。
PRANAV: --let's face it.

103
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,340
您可能无法在一生中保护系统。
You may not be able to protect your system for your entire lifetime.

104
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:57,746
但是我会说，至少要自己买，要不断地给自己买时间。
But I would say, at least buy yourself, continuously buy yourself time.

105
00:05:57,747 --> 00:05:59,080
DAVID J. MALAN：好的，我喜欢。
DAVID J. MALAN: OK, I like that.

106
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:03,589
因此，安全就是将某人排除在您的资源之外。
So security is all about keeping someone out of your resources.

107
00:06:03,589 --> 00:06:07,929
但是，正如我本人迄今所声称的那样，绝对是很难争论的。
But as I myself have claimed thus far, that's hard to argue in the absolute.

108
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:13,960
确实，您希望您的系统花太多时间来妥协，您的手机
Really you want your system to just take too much time to compromise, your phone

109
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:16,839
或您的笔记本电脑花费太多时间进行折衷，此时
or your laptop to take too much time to compromise, at which point

110
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:21,399
您在概率上，统计上对付对手是安全的。
you're sort of probabilistically, statistically safe against adversaries.

111
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:24,489
再次因为他们不想浪费那么多时间或精力
Because again, they're not going to want to waste that much time or effort

112
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,790
或金钱入侵您的特定系统而不是其他人。
or money hacking into your particular system versus someone else.

113
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:30,940
现在，您和我在现实世界中有不同的方式
Now, there are different ways that you and I in the real world

114
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:34,179
尝试保持笔记本电脑和手机的安全。
try to keep our laptops and our phones secure.

115
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,240
当然，最流行的机制之一就是密码。
And one of those most popular mechanisms is, of course, passwords.

116
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,320
密码，是某种短语，实际上是某种数字
Passwords, being some kind of phrase, some kind of number that you actually

117
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:45,849
配置您的设备，以便理想情况下只有您知道该密码。
configure your device with so that ideally, only you know that password.

118
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:49,570
因此，只有您才能使用该密码进入设备。
And only you, therefore, can get into the device by using that password.

119
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:51,939
因此，通过举手示意，你们中有多少人
And so by a show of physical hands, how many of you

120
00:06:51,939 --> 00:06:55,089
在笔记本电脑或台式机上输入密码
have passwords on your laptops or desktops

121
00:06:55,089 --> 00:06:56,889
如果您使用这些设备之一？
if you use one of those devices?

122
00:06:56,889 --> 00:06:59,259
所以几乎所有的人都举起了手。
So almost all of the hands are going up.

123
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:02,319
那些没有举手的人，您可能已经做到了，
Those of you who don't have your hand going up, you've probably made,

124
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,869
我认为，有意识的选择是不使用密码。
I presume, a conscious choice to not use a password.

125
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,342
也许很烦人。
Maybe it's annoying to type in.

126
00:07:06,341 --> 00:07:08,049
也许你真的不担心任何人
Maybe you don't really worry about anyone

127
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,508
进入设备的周围。
around you getting into the device.

128
00:07:09,507 --> 00:07:13,119
但是您应该承认或意识到存在威胁。
But you should concede or recognize that there is therefore a threat.

129
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,690
有人进入您的笔记本电脑或台式机要容易得多
It's much easier for someone to get into your laptop or desktop

130
00:07:16,689 --> 00:07:20,629
然后就是刚才其他举手的人。
then into that of anyone else who raised their hand just a moment ago.

131
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:25,149
现在，那些拥有电话，移动设备，
Now, those of you who have a phone, a mobile device, those

132
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:27,099
使用该设备的人当中，有多少人拥有
of you with that device, how many of you have

133
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:31,300
您手机上该设备上的密码或密码？
a password or a passcode on that device, on your phone?

134
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,785
我所看到的手少了一些。
So somewhat fewer hands I'm seeing.

135
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,660
因此，有很多人举手是很好的。
So it's good that so many hands are going up.

136
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,850
但是那里也似乎有些人没有。
But there, too, it seems that some of you don't have.

137
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,017
希望您已经考虑了其中的含义
And hopefully, you've thought about the implications

138
00:07:39,016 --> 00:07:43,209
其中，这意味着您的父母，兄弟姐妹，陌生人（如果他们只是
of that, which means that your parents, your siblings, a stranger, if they just

139
00:07:43,209 --> 00:07:45,759
亲自接听电话，无论是在家中
physically pick up your phone, whether it's in your home

140
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,619
或在咖啡馆或机场中，可以立即访问您的所有数据。
or in a cafe or an airport, has immediate access to all of your data.

141
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,340
因此，可以肯定地说，安全性要差得多
So arguably, much less secure, certainly,

142
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:53,659
而不是需要密码的人。
than someone that requires a password.

143
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:58,180
但是，让我们考虑一下我们如何衡量您手机的安全性，
But let's consider how we can measure the security of your phone,

144
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,130
衡量您计算机的安全性
measure the security of your computer, just

145
00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:03,699
通过使用这种简单的熟悉机制，例如密码。
by using this simple familiar mechanism, like, a password.

146
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:06,624
事实证明，你和我坦白地说，作为人类，
So it turns out that you and I, frankly, as humans,

147
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:09,250
首先不是很擅长选择这些密码。
aren't very good at picking these passwords in the first place.

148
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:12,819
截至2019年，就在几个月前的年底，
As of 2019, just some months ago at year's end,

149
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:16,509
安全研究人员认为这很可悲，
this was determined by security researchers to be sadly,

150
00:08:16,509 --> 00:08:21,579
世界上最常用的密码，字面意思是123456。
the most common password in the world, literally, 123456.

151
00:08:21,579 --> 00:08:23,679
那是最常见的密码
That was the most common password according

152
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,360
过去一年来，在已知的密码中采取了许多措施。
to many measures this past year among those passwords that were known.

153
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,440
名单上的第二名稍好一点，为123456789。
Number two on the list was slightly better, 123456789.

154
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,206
之后是qwerty。
After that was qwerty.

155
00:08:34,206 --> 00:08:37,539
如果那个看起来有点怪异，如果您有美式英语键盘并且您看起来
If that one looks a little weird, if you have a US English keyboard and you look

156
00:08:37,538 --> 00:08:42,579
在键的左上角，QWERTY是它们的拼写形式
at the top left row of your keys, Q-W-E-R-T-Y is what they would spell

157
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,659
在美国键盘上。
on a US keyboard.

158
00:08:43,658 --> 00:08:46,759
人们确实不是很努力地想出自己的密码，
People are really not trying very hard to come up with their password,

159
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,419
即使从技术上讲它本身不是英语单词。
even though it's not technically an English word, per se.

160
00:08:49,419 --> 00:08:54,159
密码是最受欢迎的第四大密码，
Password was the number four most popular password, P-A-S-S-W-O-R-D,

161
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,369
这太勉强了，一点都不安全。
which is a little too tongue in cheek to be at all secure.

162
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:03,520
此后情况稍差一些，为1234567；之后是12345678；在那之后，
After that was slightly worse, 1234567; after that, 12345678; after that,

163
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,689
12345。
12345.

164
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,400
您也许可以在这里看到模式。
You can perhaps see the pattern here.

165
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,919
值得庆幸的是，在那之后，我爱你。
After that was, adorably, iloveyou.

166
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:12,909
但是，如果您认为使用iloveyou作为密码会很聪明，
But if you think you're being clever by having iloveyou as your password,

167
00:09:12,909 --> 00:09:15,189
好吧，世界上还有很多其他人
well, there's a lot of other humans in the world that

168
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,930
认为他们也很可爱。
think they're being cute, too.

169
00:09:16,929 --> 00:09:19,989
111111也很受欢迎。
111111 was also popular.

170
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:23,020
最后是123123。
And then lastly, 123123.

171
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:24,459
那么，现在为什么要使用这些密码？
So now why these passwords?

172
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:27,880
您也许可以从此列表中推断出其中一些密码的原因
You can perhaps infer from this list why some of these passwords

173
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:29,169
是他们的样子。
are the way that they are.

174
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:34,509
奇怪的是这些人在电话或网站上使用了这些密码
Odds are these people were using these passwords on phones or on websites

175
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:38,499
或在其他可能具有最小密码长度的系统中。
or in other systems that probably had, like, a minimum password length.

176
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,669
这些人可能需要一个六个字符长的密码。
These people probably needed a password that was six characters long.

177
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:47,029
这些人可能需要一个9个字符长的字符，依此类推。
These people probably needed one that was nine characters long, and so forth.

178
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:49,359
所以您也许可以看到一些政策表现
So you can perhaps see some manifestations of policies

179
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,200
公司，大学和软件制造商
that companies and universities and software manufacturers

180
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,520
可能已经到位。
might have in place.

181
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:57,309
但只要说出您的密码在此列表中，就足够了，
But suffice it to say, if your password is on this list,

182
00:09:57,309 --> 00:10:00,099
您今天的讨论的第一要点
your first takeaway from today's discussion

183
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,440
应该更改该密码-
should be change that password--

184
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,713
至少在乎您的帐户时。
at least if you care about the account.

185
00:10:04,712 --> 00:10:06,879
我也会说，我们将回到这一点，
And I would argue, too, and we'll come back to this,

186
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:09,519
它真的应该考虑到您的决策中
it really probably should figure into your decision making

187
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,809
它是什么类型的帐户。
what type of account it is.

188
00:10:10,809 --> 00:10:14,019
如果您不想再使用某些愚蠢的网站或游戏，
If it's for some silly website or game that you're never going to use again,

189
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:15,249
也许这没什么大不了的。
maybe it's not a big deal.

190
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:19,000
如果是您的银行帐户，您的学生记录，与医疗相关的内容，
If it's your bank account, your student record, something medical related,

191
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,040
可能您真的不希望您的密码出现在此列表中。
probably you really don't want your password on this list.

192
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:26,979
因此，在这里也要考虑我们做出当今所有决策的环境。
So there, too, consider the context in which we make all of today's decisions.

193
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,900
现在，为什么这些密码不好？
Now, why are these passwords bad?

194
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:32,119
为什么密码本身有潜在风险？
And why are passwords themselves potentially at risk?

195
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,130
因此，计算机科学中的一个术语是蛮力攻击。
So a term of art in computer science is that of brute force attacks.

196
00:10:36,129 --> 00:10:38,589
这就是它所说的。
And this kind of is what it says.

197
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:42,990
这指的是一个对手-有人想得到你或得到某人-
This refers to an adversary-- someone who's out to get you or get someone--

198
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:50,290
拥有设备或编写软件，试图仅猜测您的密码。
has a device or writes software that tries to just guess your password.

199
00:10:50,289 --> 00:10:53,589
蛮力攻击意味着如果他们不知道您的密码，
Brute force attack means that if they don't know your password,

200
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,990
他们不只是要尝试随机数。
they're not just going to try random numbers necessarily.

201
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,570
他们将尝试111111。
They're going to try 111111.

202
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:01,420
然后他们将尝试111112。
And then they're going to try 111112.

203
00:11:01,419 --> 00:11:06,579
然后他们将尝试通过手动将111113键入手机中
Then they're going to try 111113, either manually, by typing it into the phone

204
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:09,970
他们可能是从您那里偷走的，或者可能是通过编写软件来窃取的，
that they might have stolen off of you, or maybe by writing software,

205
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,760
然后通过笔记本电脑连接该软件
and then connecting that software via a laptop

206
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:17,319
或台式机通过USB电缆或避雷针等连接到您的手机。
or desktop to your phone via USB cable or lightning connector or the like.

207
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,390
蛮力攻击几乎意味着
A brute force attack pretty much just means

208
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:23,319
对手不一定了解您-您的名字，
that the adversary doesn't necessarily know anything about you-- your name,

209
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,450
你的生日，你的孩子的名字，没什么其他的。
your birthday, your children's names, nothing like that.

210
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:29,450
但是他们确实有很多时间或技能。
But they do have a lot of time or a lot of skill.

211
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:32,140
因此，他们将尝试所有可能的密码。
And so they're just going to try all possible passwords.

212
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:35,619
我想这种攻击方式令人大开眼界
And what's eye opening, I think, about this type of attack

213
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,420
是已经给了我们机会
is that it already gives us an opportunity

214
00:11:37,419 --> 00:11:41,199
开始思考我们如何保护自己免受攻击？
to start thinking about how can we protect ourselves against an attack?

215
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,700
而现在，您在手机和计算机上的帐户的安全性如何
And just right now, how secure are your accounts on your phones and computers

216
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,590
对抗暴力攻击？
against brute force attacks?

217
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,990
好吧，让我们考虑一下对手如何做到这一点。
Well, let's consider how an adversary might do this.

218
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:52,120
这是一个愚蠢的YouTube视频。
This is kind of a silly YouTube video here.

219
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,420
但是，让我继续播放此动画，真的，
But let me go ahead and play this animation, really,

220
00:11:55,419 --> 00:12:01,629
该图显示了使用这种小型机械手打字的各种小型机械手
which shows a small robot of sorts that is typing using this little robotic arm

221
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:03,489
到那里的Android手机上。
onto an Android phone down there.

222
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,987
有一个放大的版本。
There's a zoomed in version of it.

223
00:12:04,986 --> 00:12:06,819
这几乎是蛮力攻击
And pretty much this is a brute force attack

224
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:10,330
由机器人（对手设计的物理设备）
by a robot, a physical device that an adversary has designed

225
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,390
只需输入所有可能的密码。
to just type in all possible passcodes.

226
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:14,139
即使视频本身很短，
And even though the video itself is short,

227
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:17,529
您可以想象对手要过一天，要睡觉。
you can imagine the adversary going about their day, going to sleep.

228
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:20,979
而且，这件事只会使您的密码一直残酷地被强制使用。
And this thing just keeps brute forcing its way through your password.

229
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:25,060
所以最终，它可能会很幸运，偶然发现您使用的任何代码
So eventually, it might get lucky and stumble upon whatever code you

230
00:12:25,059 --> 00:12:26,769
确实在使用。
were indeed using.

231
00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:30,802
但是，当然，也可能存在其他威胁。
But of course, there's probably other threats, too.

232
00:12:30,802 --> 00:12:31,719
还有其他威胁。
There's other threats.

233
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,900
实际上，任何服用CS50或CS50x甚至是
In fact, anyone who's taken CS50 or CS50x or even

234
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:38,919
刚开始的几周，学习了一些C或Python，
just the first few weeks of it, learning a little bit of C or Python,

235
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:41,769
两者都是通用的编程语言，任何人
both of which are common programming languages, anyone

236
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:44,019
懂一点编程的人肯定可以
who knows a little bit about programming can certainly

237
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:48,159
编写模拟该机器人的实际操作的软件。
write software that simulates what that robot was physically doing.

238
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:51,789
关于软件的事情是，一旦您没有任何活动部件，
And the thing about software is as soon as you don't have any moving parts,

239
00:12:51,789 --> 00:12:54,939
您可以更快，更轻松地完成工作，因为它们全都是电子的。
you can do things much, much faster because it's all electronic.

240
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,630
这根本不是机械的。
It's not at all mechanical.

241
00:12:56,629 --> 00:13:00,519
因此，在这种情况下，如果我要偷走您的手机怎么办
And so in this case, what if I were to steal your phone off

242
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:04,059
例如，你们中的一些人在我的Mac或PC上编写了一些软件，
of you, for instance, write some software on my Mac or PC,

243
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:06,729
然后将我的Mac或PC插入手机
and then plug my Mac or PC into your phone

244
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,580
再次使用USB电缆或闪电连接器，
with, again, a USB cable or a lightning connector,

245
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:14,050
这样我就可以编写一次又一次尝试所有可能的密码的代码？
such that I could write code that tries all possible passcodes again and again?

246
00:13:14,049 --> 00:13:16,809
例如，假设您的手机正在使用-
For instance, suppose that your phone is using--

247
00:13:16,809 --> 00:13:21,789
在iPhone或Android手机上，这并非不常见的默认设置，
and this is not an uncommon default on iPhones or on Android phones,

248
00:13:21,789 --> 00:13:23,019
至少在过去-
at least in the past--

249
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:24,069
四位数。
four digits.

250
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,170
假设您需要最少选择
Suppose that you're required to choose minimally

251
00:13:26,169 --> 00:13:30,519
密码或密码，在这里是同义词，长度为四位数。
a passcode or password, synonymous here, that are four digits long.

252
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:33,009
我们说的是十进制数字，所以0到9。
And we're talking decimal digits, so 0 through 9.

253
00:13:33,009 --> 00:13:35,349
因此，您需要0、1、2、3、4、5、6、7、8、9
So 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, you need

254
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:38,170
以某种模式选择其中四个数字。
to choose four of those digits in some pattern.

255
00:13:38,169 --> 00:13:44,229
那么，有四个四位数长的可能密码？
Well, how many possible passcodes are there that are four digits long?

256
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:48,700
如果您的密码长度为4位数字，则可以开始考虑安全性
If your passcode is 4 digits long, you can begin to think about the security

257
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,900
您的密码需要多少时间？
of your passcode in terms of, well, how long would it take an adversary

258
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:58,209
暴力破解我的真实密码（从0000开始），
to brute force their way to my actual password starting at 0000,

259
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:01,135
一直上升到例如9999。
going all the way up to, for instance, 9999.

260
00:14:01,134 --> 00:14:03,009
好吧，让我继续打开屏幕。
Well, let me go ahead and open up the screen.

261
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:07,329
如果您从前拉起相同的URL，您将在片刻内看到
If you pull up that same URL from before, you'll see in just a moment

262
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:12,070
一项民意测验会问你同样的问题，那就是，
a poll that'll ask you this very same question, that being,

263
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:15,338
可以输入多少个4位数的密码？
how many 4-digit passcodes are possible?

264
00:14:15,337 --> 00:14:17,379
稍后，您会在屏幕上看到它。
In just a moment, you'll see this on your screen.

265
00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:19,749
让我继续进行全屏播放。
Let me go ahead and full screen it on my end as well.

266
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,600
再次转到此处我屏幕上方的URL，
Go again to the URL that's atop my screen here,

267
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,770
如果您之前错过了该网址，或者恰巧关闭了该标签。
if you missed the URL earlier or happened to close the tab.

268
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:31,179
可以输入多少个4位数的密码？
How many 4-digit passcodes are possible?

269
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:33,909
可以输入多少个4位数的密码？
How many 4-digit passcodes are possible?

270
00:14:33,909 --> 00:14:40,179
在这里，答案是4或40或9,999或10,000-
Among the answers here are 4 or 40 or 9,999 or maybe 10,000--

271
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:42,939
还是很好，您不确定。
or quite fine, too, you're unsure.

272
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:50,170
如果可以的话，继续前进并提出其中一种回应。
Go ahead and buzz in with one of those responses, if you could.

273
00:14:50,169 --> 00:14:53,139
好吧，看来到目前为止我们已经收到了几百个回复。
All right, looks like we have got a few hundred responses thus far.

274
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:56,519
我们会再给您几秒钟的时间进行嗡嗡声。
We'll give you a few more seconds to buzz in.

275
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:59,159
让我继续，开始在这里显示结果。
And let me go ahead and begin to reveal the results here.

276
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:03,644
看来你们当中有很多人，超过60％
So it looks like quite a few of you, 60-plus%

277
00:15:03,644 --> 00:15:05,519
认为这是10,000种可能性。
think it's 10,000 possibilities.

278
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,729
你们中有27％的人认为这是9,999种可能性。
27% of you think it's 9,999 possibilities.

279
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,590
然后其他一些人认为是40或4。
And then a few others think it's 40 or four.

280
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,210
你们中的许多人不确定。
And a bunch of you are unsure.

281
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,130
那么，让我们考虑一下，我们将如何回答
So let's consider, then, how we would answer

282
00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:17,669
这个问题，以便我们有一个心理模型可以自己回答。
this question so that we have a mental model for answering this on our own.

283
00:15:17,669 --> 00:15:20,949
让我继续提出来回答这个问题，
Let me go ahead and propose that to answer this question,

284
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,770
我们只是做一些非常简单的算术。
we just do some very simple arithmetic.

285
00:15:22,769 --> 00:15:24,599
它并不需要变得非常复杂。
It doesn't need to get very complicated.

286
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,090
但是可以通过以下方式来考虑数学。
But the math could be thought of in the following way.

287
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:31,980
如果我们有一个4位数字的密码，那就是4位数字，每个数字
If we've got a 4-digit passcode, that's four digits, each of which

288
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,420
可以是零到九。
can be zero through nine.

289
00:15:33,419 --> 00:15:34,769
共有10个数字。
And there's 10 total digits.

290
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:37,679
因此从零到9。
Therefore zero through 9.

291
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:42,489
对于这四个数字，每个数字有八个九个十个可能的值。
Eight nine so 10 possible values for each of those four digits.

292
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:44,790
所以如果是这样的话，我认为可以这样说
So if that's the case, I think it's fair to say

293
00:15:44,789 --> 00:15:48,479
第一位数字有10种可能性乘以10种可能性
that there's 10 possibilities for the first digit times 10 possibilities

294
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,507
第二次10次10。
for the second times 10 times 10.

295
00:15:51,506 --> 00:15:53,339
当然，如果将这些全部相乘，
And of course, if you multiply this all out,

296
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,680
答案确实是10,000种可能性。
the answer was indeed 10,000 possibilities.

297
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:59,369
因此，如果您现在拥有iPhone或Android手机
So if you have an iPhone or an Android phone right now

298
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:03,060
并且您有一个4位数的密码，您认为没人知道，
and you've got a 4-digit passcode that you think no one knows,

299
00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:04,799
情况很可能如此。
that may very well be the case.

300
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:07,199
但是您应该担心或考虑，
But you should worry about or consider, well,

301
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,740
如果有一个花哨机器人的朋友将您的手机连接到该手机上会发生什么
what happens if a friend with a fancy robot connects your phone to that

302
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:18,180
并尝试使用所有可能的值（从0000到9999），或更聪明的方法，
and just tries all possible values from 0000 to 9999, or smarter still,

303
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:21,119
通过电缆将手机连接到他们的笔记本电脑，
connects your phone via cable to their laptop,

304
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,690
编写软件以生成所有这些可能性？
writes software to generate all of those possibilities?

305
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:28,740
好吧，有点令人担忧的是，后者并不难
Well, a little worrisomely, it's not all that hard to do the latter

306
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,210
并实际编写代码。
and to actually write code.

307
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:33,450
所以事实上，让我继续在这里并在自己的Mac上，让我继续
So in fact, let me go ahead here and on my own Mac, let me go ahead

308
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,540
并打开一个程序，让我写
and open up a program that's going to let me write

309
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:39,149
名为crack.py的文件中的一些代码。
some code in a file called crack.py.

310
00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:41,229
因此，“裂纹”是编程中的一种艺术术语，
So "crack" is a term of art in programming,

311
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:44,790
这意味着以某种方式强行将您的密码输入密码，
which means to brute force your way into a password somehow,

312
00:16:44,789 --> 00:16:47,506
因此要弄清楚它在算法上是什么。
so to figure out what it is algorithmically.

313
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:50,339
你们当中的那些人，尤其是从未有过的父母和家庭成员
Those of you, particularly parents and family members who have never

314
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,170
以前看过的任何东西，都很好。
seen any of this before, totally fine.

315
00:16:52,169 --> 00:16:53,579
这对您来说是新的。
That's new to you.

316
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,760
你的儿女和其他人在房间里
Your sons and daughters and others here in the room

317
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:58,439
几乎看不到这段代码。
have seen little bit of this code.

318
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,080
但是，我们将其简短化，也就是说，实际上
But we'll keep it short, which is to say that it actually

319
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,680
无需花费太多精力来编写残酷的代码
doesn't take all that much effort to write code that brute

320
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,496
在您自己的手机上强行发起攻击。
forces an attack on your own phone.

321
00:17:06,496 --> 00:17:09,329
我要在此处编写的代码是使用一种称为Python的语言，
And the code I'm going to write here is in a language called Python,

322
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,078
这些天很受欢迎。
which is quite popular these days.

323
00:17:11,078 --> 00:17:15,449
我要说的是这样的命令，从字符串导入数字开始，
And I'm going to say a command like this, from string import digits, which

324
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:18,520
在Python这种编程语言中只是一种聪明的方法，
is just a clever way in Python, this programming language,

325
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:22,289
只需让我访问所有可能的十进制数字（0到9）即可。
just give me access to all the possible digits in decimal, 0 through 9.

326
00:17:22,289 --> 00:17:26,429
然后我要从一个库中导入一些软件
And then I'm going to import, so to speak, from a library, some software

327
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:29,940
其他一些聪明人写的东西，叫做产品。
that some other smart people wrote, something called product.

328
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,010
事实证明，用一种编程语言，
So it turns out, in a programming language,

329
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,649
您有很多功能。
you have lots of functions or functionality.

330
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:38,110
就像在数学世界中一样，您拥有一些函数，例如加法，减法，
Much like in the world of math, you have functions, like, addition, subtraction,

331
00:17:38,109 --> 00:17:39,329
乘法和除法。
multiplication, and division.

332
00:17:39,329 --> 00:17:42,509
在编程世界中，您拥有所有这些功能，
In the world of programming, you have all of those capabilities,

333
00:17:42,509 --> 00:17:43,499
但还有更多。
but many more.

334
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,899
所以我要在这里导入的功能之一
And so one of the functions I'm importing here

335
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,090
是产品的概念，这实际上意味着
is this notion of a product, which really just means

336
00:17:48,089 --> 00:17:52,177
所有可能数字的排列。
a permutation of all possible digits.

337
00:17:52,178 --> 00:17:54,720
现在，我将在编程中使用所谓的循环。
And now I'm going to use what's called a loop in programming.

338
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,803
程序中的循环只是一次又一次地做某事。
A loop in a program is just something that does something again and again.

339
00:17:57,803 --> 00:18:00,270
我将继续讲这个，以获取密码
And I'm going to go ahead and say this, for passcode

340
00:18:00,269 --> 00:18:06,659
输入所有这些数字的乘积，然后重复这些数字总计四次，
in, the product of all of those digits, and repeat the digits four times total,

341
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,810
继续并打印出每个密码。
go ahead and print out each passcode.

342
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:13,439
让我继续使用某种含糊的语法将其打印出来。
Let me go ahead and print it out using somewhat cryptic syntax.

343
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,310
但这仅仅是因为我要打印出一个列表作为实际字符串。
But that's only because I'm going to print out a list as an actual string.

344
00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:20,139
父母和家庭成员，现在不必担心这意味着什么。
Parents and family members, don't worry for now what that means.

345
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,370
CS50和CS50x的学生，这只是一个聪明的方法
CS50 and CS50x students, this is just a clever way

346
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:26,009
用几行代码进行迭代
with a couple of lines of code to iterate over

347
00:18:26,009 --> 00:18:30,389
从0到9的所有数字，一次将它们四个组合在一起，
all of the digits 0 through 9, combine them four at a time,

348
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:35,200
并打印出这四个数字的所有可能排列。
and print out all possible permutations of those four digits.

349
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,430
因此，如果我没有在这里搞砸，我将继续保存我的文件并运行
So if I didn't screw up here, I'm going to go ahead and save my file and run

350
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:42,780
在crack.py上执行名为python的命令，然后按Enter键
a command called python on crack.py and hit Enter--

351
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:43,784
繁荣。
boom.

352
00:18:43,785 --> 00:18:45,090
那太快了。
That was so fast.

353
00:18:45,089 --> 00:18:46,409
实际上，让我再做一次。
In fact, let me do it again.

354
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:49,590
让我清除屏幕，然后重新运行这个crack.py程序-
Let me clear my screen and rerun this crack.py program--

355
00:18:49,589 --> 00:18:50,609
繁荣。
boom.

356
00:18:50,609 --> 00:18:53,789
那就是一台计算机，我的小Mac在这里，
That's how fast a computer, my little Mac here,

357
00:18:53,789 --> 00:18:59,039
可以尝试使用0000到9999之间的所有可能代码。
can try all possible codes between 0000 and 9999.

358
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,919
它之所以如此之快，是因为它们在一瞬间就完成了所有操作。
And it's so fast because it did them all in the blink of an eye.

359
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,920
因此，如果您认为自己的4位数密码使您有所保留
So if you're thinking that your 4-digit passcode is keeping you somewhat

360
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:09,630
安全，实际上可能不是因为不需要那么多精力
secure, it probably really isn't because it wouldn't take that much effort

361
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,360
也许你家里有人写这样的代码，
for maybe someone in your household to write code like this,

362
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:15,401
晚上不注意的时候秘密连接到手机，
connect to your phone secretly at night when you're not paying attention,

363
00:19:15,402 --> 00:19:18,490
并可能找出您的代码实际上是什么。
and figure out, potentially, what your code actually is.

364
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,535
那么，有什么比仅使用数字更好的呢？
So what would be better than using just digits?

365
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:22,410
有什么更好的办法？
What would be better?

366
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:25,118
好吧，为什么我们不使用字母，英文字母，
Well, why don't we use letters of the alphabet, English alphabet,

367
00:19:25,117 --> 00:19:26,309
为了今天的目的？
for today's purposes?

368
00:19:26,309 --> 00:19:31,109
在英文字母中，字母比数字多。
And in the English alphabet, we have more letters than we have numbers.

369
00:19:31,109 --> 00:19:32,874
那么我们怎么考虑呢？
So how might we think about this?

370
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,500
让我们继续在这里问一个问题。
Let's go ahead and ask a question here.

371
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,959
如果您今天后要更换手机以使用
If you change your phone after today to use

372
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:43,810
英文字母的四个字母，而不是单独使用数字，
four letters of the English alphabet instead of using numbers alone,

373
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:45,939
那有多少种可能性？
how many possibilities are there then?

374
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,910
好吧，让我继续在这里提出一个不同的民意调查问题，
Well, let me go ahead and open up a different poll question here,

375
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:54,420
哪个问这次，可以输入多少个4个字母的密码？
which asks this time, how many 4-letter passcodes are possible?

376
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,710
我们将看到人们对此的想法和答案，
And we'll see what folks think and answer to this,

377
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,300
随着答案开始出现。
as the answers begin to come in.

378
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,805
公平地说，我还没有限定一件事。
To be fair, I have not qualified one thing.

379
00:20:02,805 --> 00:20:04,930
因此，您可能必须做出某些假设。
So you might have to be making certain assumptions.

380
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:07,930
确实有26个英文字母。
There are indeed 26 letters of the English alphabet.

381
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:10,720
但是，有大写和小写字母。
However, there's uppercase and lowercase.

382
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,300
因此，如果您允许用户在某种情况下键入
So if you allow the user to type in something case

383
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:16,009
可以这么说，在某些情况下，
sensitively, so to speak, where case matters,

384
00:20:16,009 --> 00:20:19,659
这四个字符中的每一个都不是26种可能性。
it's not 26 possibilities for each of those four characters.

385
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,130
相反，它有52种可能性。
It's instead 52 possibilities.

386
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:24,940
看来您占了绝大多数，78％
So it looks like an overwhelming number of you, 78%

387
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:27,790
认为当有七百万种可能性时
think there's some seven million possibilities when

388
00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:29,589
使用4个字母的密码。
using 4-letter passcodes.

389
00:20:29,589 --> 00:20:33,889
大约11％的人认为52,000个都是密码。
About 11% of you think that 52,000 are all of the passcodes.

390
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:35,570
因此，让我们继续进行快速数学运算。
So let's go ahead and do the quick math.

391
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:38,319
同样，它不需要特别复杂的数学运算。
Again, it doesn't need to be particularly sophisticated, the math.

392
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:41,859
让我这次继续开放，类似的方法
Let me go ahead and open up this time, similar approach

393
00:20:41,859 --> 00:20:45,081
这个问题，如果我们有四个字母，
to this problem, whereby if we have four letters of the alphabet,

394
00:20:45,082 --> 00:20:47,290
并假设大小写敏感，这是公平的，
and let's assume case sensitivity, which, to be fair,

395
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:49,389
你可能没有假设，好吧，那我想
you might not have assumed, well, then I think

396
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:53,140
我们有52次机会52次52次
we have 52 possibilities times 52 times 52 times

397
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:57,970
密码中的四个字母中的每个字母为52。
52 for each of the four letters in your passcode.

398
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,860
如果你乘以它-繁荣-
And if you multiply that out-- boom--

399
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:03,739
您确实可以获得700万以上的可能性。
you indeed get seven million plus possibilities.

400
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,830
因此，在这里考虑外卖。
So consider the takeaway here.

401
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:10,719
如果您当前使用的密码是四位数（纯数字），
If you are currently using a passcode that's four digits, purely numeric,

402
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,980
您和一些攻击性黑客之间只有10,000位数
you have only 10,000 digits between you and some adversary hacking

403
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,510
插入您的手机中。
into your phone potentially.

404
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:20,529
如果您将4位数密码更改为4字母密码，
If you change your 4-digit passcode to be a 4-letter passcode,

405
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,979
那么您就有了700万种可能的密码
then you've got seven million possible passcodes

406
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,420
在你和对手之间。
between you and the adversary.

407
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,660
现在，为什么这样更好？
Now, why is this better?

408
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,710
好吧，再说一次，无论他们使用的是机器人还是代码，
Well, again, whether they're using a robot or using code,

409
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:32,912
只会花更多时间让他们入侵您的设备。
it's just going to take them more time to hack into your device.

410
00:21:32,912 --> 00:21:34,870
再说一遍，如果要
And again, at that point, if it's going to take

411
00:21:34,869 --> 00:21:36,702
他们那么多的时间，那么多的努力，也许
them that much time, that much effort, maybe

412
00:21:36,702 --> 00:21:41,079
相对于其他人，即使有那么多钱可以入侵您的手机
even that much money to hack into your phone, you, relative to other people

413
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:43,719
可能确实更安全，因为它可能
might indeed be more secure because it's probably

414
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,990
对手更容易偷别人的电话
going to be easier for that adversary to go steal someone else's phone

415
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:49,000
并尝试进入那个。
and try to get into that one instead.

416
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,819
好吧，让我们考虑一下这在实际代码中的作用。
Well, let's consider what this does in actual code.

417
00:21:51,819 --> 00:21:54,969
让我回到这里的Mac。
Let me go back to my Mac here.

418
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:58,000
让我继续打开与以前相同的文件。
And let me go ahead and open up that same file as before.

419
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,500
让我继续进行以下更改。
And let me go ahead and change something as follows.

420
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,629
让我使用不叫数字的字母来代替ASCII字母。
Instead of using just digits, let me use what I'm going to call ASCII letters.

421
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:07,480
不熟悉CS，ASCII的家庭
Families who are not familiar with CS, ASCII

422
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,080
仅指基本上所有可打印的字母
just refers to essentially all of the printable letters of the alphabet

423
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:15,429
通常会用英语看到，所以A到Z，大写和小写
that you would typically see in English, so A through Z, capital and lowercase

424
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:15,970
这里。
here.

425
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:18,345
我将继续更改我对数字的提及
And I'm going to go ahead and change my mention of digits

426
00:22:18,345 --> 00:22:20,300
这里也是ASCII字母。
here to be ASCII letters as well.

427
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:22,389
同样，该程序几乎是相同的。
So again, the program is almost identical.

428
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:27,010
但是它将使用全部52个大写和小写英文字母来代替
But it's going to use all 52 uppercase and lowercase English letters instead

429
00:22:27,009 --> 00:22:28,929
全部10位数字。
of all 10 digits.

430
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,350
让我保存此文件。
Let me save this file.

431
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:33,129
让我重新运行crack.py的python。
Let me rerun python of crack.py.

432
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:36,910
这次我实际上有一点时间走到屏幕上
And this time I actually have a moment to walk over to the screen

433
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:40,810
并指出现在我们刚刚通过小写字母zs。
and point out now that we're just now through the lower case zs.

434
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:42,999
现在我们正在检查所有可能的密码
Now we're going through all the possible passcodes

435
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,530
以大写字母开头。
that start with capital letters.

436
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,999
它仍然相当快。
It's still pretty fast.

437
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,939
大概10秒钟后完成了什么？
This is maybe, what, 10 seconds later done?

438
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:52,690
我们从AAAA转到ZZZZ。
We went from AAAA to ZZZZ.

439
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:54,040
因此，我们提高了标准。
So we've raised the bar.

440
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:58,329
同样，在这种情况下，我们手机的安全性可以说更高。
And again, the security of our phone in this case is arguably more.

441
00:22:58,329 --> 00:23:00,189
更高，因为现在需要
It's higher because now it's going to take

442
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:04,870
攻击者需要花费更多的时间或更多的精力才能真正入侵我们的设备。
the adversary more time or more effort to actually hack into our device.

443
00:23:04,869 --> 00:23:07,119
好吧，那么也许让我们考虑另一个问题。
Well, let's consider, perhaps, another question, then.

444
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:11,409
如果我们进一步将其概括为字符怎么办？
What if we generalize it further to be characters?

445
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:13,277
你们当中的那些人，也许，
And those of you among families, perhaps,

446
00:23:13,277 --> 00:23:15,860
可能不知道字符和字母之间的区别。
might not know the distinction between characters and letters.

447
00:23:15,859 --> 00:23:17,829
因此，我将其打开到这里的地板上。
So let me open this up to the floor here.

448
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:20,139
这些天当您注册网站时，
When you register for a website these days,

449
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,750
这有点烦人，因为这些网站通常
it's somewhat annoying because those websites typically

450
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:25,839
强迫您选择一个好的密码。
force you to choose a good password.

451
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:28,989
好的密码通常意味着什么？
And what do they typically mean by good password?

452
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:33,130
这些天，您甚至在网站登录之前通常必须包含什么密码？
What does your password these days often have to contain before the website even

453
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:35,060
让你继续吗？
lets you proceed?

454
00:23:35,059 --> 00:23:36,579
有什么想法吗？
Any thoughts?

455
00:23:36,579 --> 00:23:37,239
让我们看看。
And let's see.

456
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,240
布莱恩，我们有谁？
Brian, who do we have?

457
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,492
达克斯呢？
How about Dax?

458
00:23:39,491 --> 00:23:40,449
你觉得呢？你有没有什么想法？
What are your thoughts?

459
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:44,245
DAX：至少八个字符，一个数字和一个大写字母。
DAX: Eight characters at the very least, number, and a capital.

460
00:23:44,244 --> 00:23:46,369
DAVID J. MALAN：至少是数字和字符。
DAVID J. MALAN: So at least a number and character.

461
00:23:46,369 --> 00:23:47,259
因此，将两者结合起来。
So combine the two.

462
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:47,989
我喜欢。
I like that.

463
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:53,290
因此，我们有26个，而不是26个，52个或10个
So instead of 26 or 52 or 10, we instead have, maybe, 62

464
00:23:53,289 --> 00:23:54,939
如果我们结合字母和数字。
if we combine letters and numbers.

465
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,910
有关什么网站通常的其他想法-
Other thoughts on what websites typically--

466
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:57,910
DAX：特殊字符。
DAX: Special characters.

467
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:59,327
DAVID J. MALAN：-强迫您做？
DAVID J. MALAN: --force you to do?

468
00:23:59,326 --> 00:24:02,279
DAX：特殊字符-星号，主题标签，美元符号。
DAX: Special characters-- asterisk, hashtag, dollar sign.

469
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:05,412
DAVID J. MALAN：好的，所以是特殊字符或标点符号。
DAVID J. MALAN: OK, so special characters or punctuation characters.

470
00:24:05,413 --> 00:24:06,580
因此，也许这是一个哈希符号。
So maybe it's a hash symbol.

471
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:09,697
可能是一个感叹号，一个括号，一个逗号，一个句点，
Maybe it's an exclamation point, a parenthesis, a comma, a period,

472
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,365
是的-是的，这些符号。
something else-- yeah, so these symbols.

473
00:24:11,365 --> 00:24:13,870
坦白说，我可能和你一样生气
And frankly, I get as annoyed as you probably

474
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:16,754
当这些网站使您烦恼时说，不，
do when these websites annoy you and say, no,

475
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:18,130
您不能使用该密码。
that you can't use that password.

476
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,570
不，您不能使用该密码。
No, you can't use that password.

477
00:24:19,569 --> 00:24:21,944
您需要选择一些很难猜测的东西。
You need to choose something that's much harder to guess.

478
00:24:21,944 --> 00:24:26,239
但是的确，如果我们将标点符号添加到组合中，我认为我们可以做得更好。
But indeed, if we add punctuation to the mix, I think we can do even better.

479
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,922
因此，实际上，字符是任何类型的字符。
In fact, a character, therefore, is any type of character.

480
00:24:29,922 --> 00:24:30,880
也许是标点符号。
Maybe it's punctuation.

481
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,713
也许是一封信。
Maybe it's a letter.

482
00:24:31,712 --> 00:24:33,979
也许是数字，不仅仅只是字母。
Maybe it's a digit, unlike just letters alone.

483
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,040
因此，如果我们有四个字符，事实证明
So if we have four characters, it turns out

484
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:39,669
通常，至少使用ASCII的CS50学生会知道的系统，
that typically, at least in ASCII, the system that CS50 students will know,

485
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:44,050
通常使用计算机，每个符号有94种可能性
computers typically use, there's 94 possibilities for each symbol

486
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:47,589
因为您有10位数字，零到九。
because you've got 10 digits, zero through nine.

487
00:24:47,589 --> 00:24:51,339
您有26个小写字母，26个大写字母-然后
You've got 26 lowercase letters, 26 uppercase letters-- and then

488
00:24:51,339 --> 00:24:55,959
如果您用英文键盘算出它们，则该数字会多出32个字符
if you count them up on an English keyboard, 32 characters more that

489
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,690
代表标点符号，例如散列和感叹号
represent punctuation, like, hashes and exclamation

490
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,010
点，逗号和句点。
points and commas and periods.

491
00:25:00,009 --> 00:25:03,079
因此，如果每种符号都有94种可能性，
So if you have 94 possibilities for each of those symbols,

492
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:08,839
原来，您总共有7800万个可能的密码。
it turns out that you then have a total of 78 million possible passcodes.

493
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:10,279
那是相当不错的。
And that's pretty good.

494
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:12,889
现在我们真的在提高对手的门槛
Now we're really raising the bar to the adversary

495
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:18,140
因为现在他们不得不浪费更多时间尝试破解您的密码。
because now they have to waste even more time trying to hack into your passcode.

496
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,170
实际上，让我继续进行一些实际代码的模拟。
And in fact, let me go ahead and simulate that with some actual code.

497
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:23,990
让我继续并打开与以前相同的程序。
Let me go ahead and open up my same program as before.

498
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:27,290
这次让我继续，不仅导入ASCII字母，
And this time let me go ahead and import not just ASCII letters,

499
00:25:27,289 --> 00:25:30,559
还要是数字，甚至是标点符号。
but also digits, and also literally, punctuation.

500
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:33,199
我用这种语言编写的代码从字面上称为Python
The code I'm writing in this language called Python literally

501
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,600
使我可以使用所有可打印的标点符号
gives me access to all printable punctuation

502
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:38,239
通过仅使用第一行代码导入它。
by just importing it with this first line of code.

503
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,390
我只需要在此处更改一行代码即可。
And I just need to change one line of code down here.

504
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:47,930
我实际上需要说ASCII字母加数字加标点符号。
I need to actually say ASCII letters plus digits plus punctuation.

505
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:52,160
因此，这是用于联接多个列表的Python速记符号。
So this is Python shorthand notation for joining multiple lists.

506
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,580
您当中的那些CS50学生会知道您可以加入两个列表，也许，
Those CS50 students among you will know that you can join two lists, perhaps,

507
00:25:55,579 --> 00:25:57,709
以这种方式，使用看起来像串联的东西。
in this way, using what looks like concatenation.

508
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:59,940
但是有了列表，它将它们全部组合在一起。
But with lists, it combines them all together.

509
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,760
但是我仍然要在这里做长度4。
But I'm still going to do of length 4 here.

510
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:03,619
现在让我继续保存该程序
Now let me go ahead and save this program

511
00:26:03,619 --> 00:26:05,989
并将其作为crack.py的python重新运行。
and rerun it as python of crack.py.

512
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:10,550
现在，坦率地说，我可以花点时间走到屏幕上
And now I can frankly take my time walking over to the screen

513
00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:14,629
因为现在您在屏幕上看到的是四个可能的符号。
because now what you're seeing on the screen is four possible symbols.

514
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:18,230
但这包括32个可能的标点符号
But it's including 32 possible punctuation symbols, which

515
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:20,630
表示此列表更长了，对吧？
means this list is much longer, right?

516
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,700
在故事的这一点上，我们已经
At this point in the story, we were already

517
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:26,280
通过所有小写字母，直到Z为止。
through all of the lowercase letters up through Z a moment ago.

518
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:32,899
现在我们只有Ms，Ns，Os，Ps，也就是说，
Now we're only at the Ms, Ns, Os, Ps, which is to say,

519
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,480
如果我的Mac不只是将其打印在屏幕上，
that if my Mac weren't just printing this on the screen,

520
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,870
但是却连接到我偷走的手机上
but were instead connected to your phone that I stole and somehow

521
00:26:38,869 --> 00:26:41,989
将所有这些可能的密码发送到您的手机中，
sending all of these possible passcodes into your phone,

522
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:44,930
要花很多时间才能真正解决。
it would be taking this much time to actually solve.

523
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:47,630
现在，公平地说，我们几乎是小写的zs。
Now, to be fair, we're almost at the lowercase zs.

524
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:52,400
因此，如果我们拖延一两分钟，该程序也将完成。
So if we stall for a minute or two longer, this program, too, will finish.

525
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,420
因此，即使有7800万种可能性也不是那么令人印象深刻。
So even 78 million possibilities is not all that impressive.

526
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:00,810
因此，我敢说我们应该做得比这更好。
And so I daresay that we should do even better than this.

527
00:27:00,809 --> 00:27:05,419
那么，什么比使用四个字符更好的密码呢？
So what might be better than four characters for a password?

528
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,980
有什么想法或志愿者吗？
Any thoughts or volunteers?

529
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:10,790
有什么比四个字符更好的密码呢？
What would be a better password than four characters, where,

530
00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:16,529
同样，每个字符是字母，数字还是标点符号？
again, each character is a letter, a number, or a punctuation symbol?

531
00:27:16,529 --> 00:27:17,529
该列表非常好。
The list is pretty good.

532
00:27:17,529 --> 00:27:19,237
但我认为我们可以做得更好，因为即使
But I think we can do better because even

533
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:22,290
这将在一分钟内完成。
this will be done in under a minute.

534
00:27:22,289 --> 00:27:23,849
是的，对此有想法，狮子座？
Yeah, thoughts about it, Leo?

535
00:27:23,849 --> 00:27:25,589
狮子座：对。
LEO: Right.

536
00:27:25,589 --> 00:27:28,309
使用更长的密码，例如至少八个字符。
Have a longer password to use, like, at least eight characters.

537
00:27:28,309 --> 00:27:29,309
DAVID J. MALAN：完美。
DAVID J. MALAN: Perfect.

538
00:27:29,309 --> 00:27:31,267
因此，请使用至少八个密码来设置更长的密码。
So have a longer password using at least eight.

539
00:27:31,268 --> 00:27:33,777
请注意，我们甚至现在正在查看数字。
And notice here, we're even now going through the numbers.

540
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,860
但是似乎我们已经完成了这些数字。
But we're almost done, it seems, with the numbers.

541
00:27:35,859 --> 00:27:37,419
但是现在我们正在经历标点符号。
But now we're going through punctuation.

542
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,837
但是再说一次，如果我再给它一点时间-我认为
But again, if I give this a little more time-- and I think

543
00:27:39,836 --> 00:27:41,017
我有点太热心了。
I was a little overzealous.

544
00:27:41,018 --> 00:27:42,810
一分钟之内可能不会飞。
Under a minute probably isn't going to fly.

545
00:27:42,809 --> 00:27:45,569
但是可以肯定的是，在课程结束时，这已经完成了。
But certainly, by the end of class, that will have been done.

546
00:27:45,569 --> 00:27:48,659
但是，如果我们做得更好并且使用八个字符怎么办？
But what if we do a little better and use eight characters?

547
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,970
好吧，八个字符将花费更长的时间。
Well, eight characters is going to take even longer.

548
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:54,403
但是，让我们继续前进，问问所有人这可能需要多长时间。
But let's go ahead and ask you all how much longer this might take.

549
00:27:54,403 --> 00:27:56,820
让我继续提出一个不同的问题，
Let me go ahead and open up a somewhat different question,

550
00:27:56,819 --> 00:27:58,299
但精神上相似。
but similar in spirit.

551
00:27:58,299 --> 00:28:01,299
稍后，您的屏幕上就会出现。
In just a moment that will appear on your screen.

552
00:28:01,299 --> 00:28:05,009
这里的问题将是多少个8字符密码
And the question here is going to be how many 8-character passcodes are

553
00:28:05,009 --> 00:28:06,059
可能的？
possible?

554
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,279
这次我挥手致意。
And this time I'm waving my hand at it.

555
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:11,309
我什至还没有去做精确的数学运算。
I didn't even bother doing the math precisely yet.

556
00:28:11,309 --> 00:28:13,559
但我建议大约是一百万，
But I'm proposing that it's roughly a million,

557
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:18,089
10亿，1万亿，4千万，5百万。
a billion, a trillion, a quadrillion, a quintillion.

558
00:28:18,089 --> 00:28:20,736
也许有些人在这里注意到了一种模式。
Some of you are perhaps noticing a pattern here.

559
00:28:20,737 --> 00:28:22,320
然后您就直接赚了五百亿美元。
And you went straight for quintillion.

560
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:24,789
那酒吧跳得真快。
That bar jumped up really fast.

561
00:28:24,789 --> 00:28:26,159
所以也许你是对的。
So maybe you're right.

562
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,480
好本能，也许。
Good instincts, perhaps.

563
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,550
看来我们正在达到平衡。
It looks like we're getting equilibrium.

564
00:28:29,549 --> 00:28:32,189
你们中大约60％的人认为这是5百万。
About 60% of you think it's 1 quintillion.

565
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:34,350
你们中有25％的人认为这是万花筒。
25% of you think it's a quadrillion.

566
00:28:34,349 --> 00:28:36,599
然后其他人越来越少。
And then fewer and fewer for the others.

567
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:39,059
好吧，让我们看看实际的答案是什么。
Well, let's take a look at what the actual answer is.

568
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:42,639
给我一点时间，在屏幕上实际完成数学运算。
Give me just a moment to actually do out the math here on my screen.

569
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,120
如果我们在这里在屏幕上进行数学运算，
And if we do out the math on my screen here,

570
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:47,759
我们当然会看到我们需要做更多的数学运算。
we'll see, of course, that we need to do some more math.

571
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:52,619
我们需要自己做94次八次，而不是四次，
We need to do 94 times itself eight times instead of just four,

572
00:28:52,619 --> 00:28:55,349
Leo建议使用八个可能的符号。
to Leo's suggestion of using eight possible symbols.

573
00:28:55,349 --> 00:28:58,019
如果您执行此操作，则我必须考虑一下。
And if you do this out, I had to think about this.

574
00:28:58,019 --> 00:29:02,879
让我们看看实际上这是数百万，数十亿，数万亿美元，
This in fact is, let's see, we've got millions, billions, trillions,

575
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,200
四千万。
quadrillions.

576
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:04,860
知道了
Gotcha.

577
00:29:04,859 --> 00:29:07,469
因此，它不是清单上的最大选择。
So it wasn't the biggest option on the list.

578
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:09,810
答案的确是四方。
The answer is indeed quadrillion.

579
00:29:09,809 --> 00:29:12,329
因此，如果您愿意的话，请达到6万亿
So 6 quadrillion, if you will.

580
00:29:12,329 --> 00:29:15,119
但是-但是-但你们当中的粉丝
But-- but-- but those of you who are fans

581
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:18,764
有五百亿种可能性，这很漂亮
of having quintillion possibilities, which is pretty, pretty

582
00:29:18,765 --> 00:29:21,390
安全，因为这只会使对手花费更长的时间
secure because it's just going to take the adversary way longer

583
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:26,910
破解您的密码，好吧，从6万位数开始
to hack into your password, well, all it takes to go from 6 quadrillion

584
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:31,210
到五百亿个数字只是另外两个字符。
to some number of quintillion is just two more characters.

585
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:35,070
因此，实际上，如果Leo提出的密码不是8个字符，
So in fact, if Leo had proposed not an 8-character passcode,

586
00:29:35,069 --> 00:29:39,299
但是10个字符的密码，我们实际上将达到5百万。
but a 10-character passcode, we actually would have hit quintillions.

587
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:40,889
生活变得有趣。
So life gets interesting.

588
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:44,610
生命越来越安全，时间越来越长，越来越复杂
Life gets more secure, the longer and longer and more complicated

589
00:29:44,609 --> 00:29:46,379
这些密码得到。
these passcodes get.

590
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:49,140
好的，所以按照逻辑，那么你应该
All right, so by logic, then, you should all probably

591
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,210
密码不是8，而不是10。
have passcodes that are not eight, not 10.

592
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:53,280
也许他们长20个字符。
Maybe they're 20 characters long.

593
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,349
也许它们长100个字符。
Maybe they're 100 characters long.

594
00:29:55,349 --> 00:29:58,919
但是在这里，我们看到了安全性的另一个主题，即权衡。
But here we see another theme in security, that of trade-offs.

595
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:03,510
就像，最终一切可能都不会尽可能地安全，
Like, the end all is probably not to be as secure as possible,

596
00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:05,849
但是要尽可能有条件地保证安全
but to be as secure as possible conditional

597
00:30:05,849 --> 00:30:08,019
在您可能有的其他目标上。
on some other goals you might have.

598
00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:10,499
因此，让我问一下，这里的权衡是什么？
So let me ask this, what's the trade-off here?

599
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:15,240
在使您的密码越来越长，越来越复杂的过程中，
In making your password longer and longer and more and more complicated,

600
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,270
作为人，您要付出什么代价？
what price do you pay as the human?

601
00:30:18,269 --> 00:30:19,529
不利之处是什么？
What's the downside?

602
00:30:19,529 --> 00:30:22,349
在计算机科学中，就像在生活中一样，总是有一个陷阱。
In computer science, as in life, there's always a catch.

603
00:30:22,349 --> 00:30:24,069
总是有代价的。
There's always a cost.

604
00:30:24,069 --> 00:30:27,839
那么，当您使密码越来越安全时，会有什么成本呢？
So what's the cost when you make your passcode more and more secure?

605
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:28,619
有什么想法吗？
Any thoughts?

606
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:29,322
让我们看看。
Let see.

607
00:30:29,323 --> 00:30:30,240
我们有谁，布莱恩？
Who do we have, Brian?

608
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,190
到珍妮？
Over to Jenny?

609
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:32,940
你怎么认为？
What do you think?

610
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:36,480
珍妮：是的，我觉得对于人类来说这是非常困难的
JENNY: Yeah, I feel that it is very difficult for a human being

611
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,100
记住这么长的密码。
to remember such a long password.

612
00:30:38,099 --> 00:30:41,909
因此，我们甚至将这些长密码存储在系统中的某个位置
And due to that, we even store those long passwords somewhere in the system

613
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:45,267
本身，这样我们就可以在必须登录系统时使用它。
itself so that we can use that whenever we have to log in into the system.

614
00:30:45,267 --> 00:30:47,100
DAVID J. MALAN：是的，这是一个折衷方案
DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah, there's this trade-off

615
00:30:47,099 --> 00:30:48,659
只记得那些令人毛骨悚然的东西。
of just remembering the darn things.

616
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,950
而您提出了一个完美的观点。
And you make a perfect point.

617
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:54,527
如果我能再次回到我的肥皂盒，如果你是那些
If I can get on my soapbox again, if you are among those people who have pretty

618
00:30:54,527 --> 00:30:57,610
好的密码，用好的密码，我的意思是，一些数字，一些字母，
good passwords, and by good passwords, I mean, some numbers, some letters,

619
00:30:57,609 --> 00:31:02,429
标点符号，但写在工作显示器上的便利贴上，
some punctuation, but it's written on a Post-It note on your monitor at work,

620
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:06,540
或者可能是更巧妙地将其写在Microsoft Word文件中
or maybe it's slightly more cleverly written in a Microsoft Word file

621
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:08,909
在您的硬盘中，或者可能在Google文档中，
in your hard drive, or maybe it's in a Google Doc,

622
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:11,610
或者甚至在抽屉里的一张纸上-
or maybe it's even on a piece of paper in your drawer--

623
00:31:11,609 --> 00:31:14,739
当然，您只是将自己暴露于其他威胁。
you're just exposing yourself to other threats, of course.

624
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:18,123
但这也是社会学考虑或政策
But here, too, is a sociological consideration or just a policy

625
00:31:18,123 --> 00:31:20,790
考虑因素，无论您是经营企业还是大学
consideration, whether you're running a business or a university

626
00:31:20,789 --> 00:31:23,369
或只有一个有多个家庭成员的家庭。
or just a household with multiple family members.

627
00:31:23,369 --> 00:31:25,139
您自己的政策应该是什么？
What should your own policies be?

628
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:28,170
因为可以说这不是詹妮的错，也不是我们的错
Because arguably it's not Jenny's fault, it's not our fault

629
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:31,170
如果我们要把事情写在纸上
if we are resorting to writing things down on paper

630
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:34,380
如果我们的密码太难记了。
if our passwords are so darn hard to remember.

631
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,870
而且，我还没有提出建议，
And moreover, I haven't even made the suggestion yet,

632
00:31:36,869 --> 00:31:39,149
但是如果你是生活中的那些人之一
but if you are one of those people in life

633
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:42,510
谁在多个设备上使用相同的密码
who is using the same password on multiple devices

634
00:31:42,509 --> 00:31:46,619
或在多个网站或多个应用程序上，您表现不佳。
or on multiple websites or on multiple apps, you are bad.

635
00:31:46,619 --> 00:31:48,929
就像，您也在做坏事。
Like, you are also doing something bad.

636
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:49,590
为什么？
Why?

637
00:31:49,589 --> 00:31:52,769
因为如果这些应用程序或网站中的任何一个遭到破坏
Because if any one of those apps or websites is compromised

638
00:31:52,769 --> 00:31:55,079
不管您是“ iloveyou”，您的密码都将丢失
and your password gets out, whether it's "iloveyou,"

639
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,749
引用unquote，或更复杂的东西，
quote unquote, or something much more complicated,

640
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:01,680
对手现在要做的就是尝试使用相同的密码
all an adversary has to do now is try that same password

641
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,910
在您的其他帐户上。
on your other accounts.

642
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:06,372
因此，您只是通过重用密码而使自己面临更多风险。
And so you're just exposing yourself to more risk by reusing passwords.

643
00:32:06,372 --> 00:32:08,580
但是，至于詹妮，我的天哪，它在哪里结束？
But to Jenny's point here, my God, where does it end?

644
00:32:08,579 --> 00:32:12,419
现在，我需要在这个网站上输入一个非常长的随机密码，
Now I need a really long random password on this website, this one,

645
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,500
还有这个，还有这个应用程序，到处都是。
and this one, and this app, all over the place.

646
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:18,299
我的意思是，老实说，我作为一个人当然不记得所有这些密码。
I mean, honestly, I as a human certainly can't remember all of those passwords.

647
00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:21,639
即使我能做到，我仍然觉得生活中还有更好的事情要记住
And even if I could, I feel like there's better things in life to be remembering

648
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,650
而不是像这样的帐户的密码。
than passwords for accounts like this.

649
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:26,170
因此，这里肯定有一个折衷方案。
So there's surely a trade-off here.

650
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:30,790
但同样，我们的目标是以一定的可能性将对手拒之门外，
But again, the goal is to keep the adversary out with some probability,

651
00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:33,459
不一定是绝对的。
not necessarily out in the absolute.

652
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:39,040
因此，我们还能采取什么措施来防止对手入侵我们的系统
So what else can we do to prevent the adversary from hacking into our systems

653
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,879
这样我就可以拥有更简单，更易记的密码，
so that I can have a somewhat easier, more memorable passcode,

654
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,110
但至少要把它们拒之门外？
but at least keep them out?

655
00:32:44,109 --> 00:32:45,859
好吧，这是您的截图
Well, here's a screenshot of something you

656
00:32:45,859 --> 00:32:48,099
可能是偶然发生的，也许是晚了
might have done by accident, perhaps late

657
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:51,009
晚上有点昏昏欲睡或有点模糊的眼神，
at night when a little groggy, or a little blurry-eyed,

658
00:32:51,009 --> 00:32:54,669
尝试多次错误输入您的密码。
trying to type in your password incorrectly too many times.

659
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:56,980
实际上，通过举手示意，有多少人
In fact, by a show of physical hands, how many people

660
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:01,840
通过输入错误的密码将自己锁定在手机之外
have locked yourself out of your phone before by typing in the wrong password

661
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:02,739
太多次了？
too many times?

662
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,870
我确实做到了，就像前几天一样。
I did it, like, literally just the other day.

663
00:33:04,869 --> 00:33:07,909
以iPhone为例，它看起来有点像这样。
And so on iPhone, for instance, it looks a little something like this.

664
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:11,660
如果我们放大图像，请注意提示，请在1分钟内重试。
And if we zoom in, notice that it's saying, try again in 1 minute.

665
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:14,570
因此，您不必抛弃电话就可以重新开始。
So you don't have to get rid of the phone and start over.

666
00:33:14,569 --> 00:33:17,049
但是iPhone告诉您一分钟后再回来。
But the iPhone is telling you to come back in a minute.

667
00:33:17,049 --> 00:33:19,959
如果我们看一下Android，类似的东西-
And if we look at, for instance, Android, something similar--

668
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,300
当然，您的Android壁纸会有所不同。
your Android wallpaper will differ, certainly.

669
00:33:22,299 --> 00:33:25,299
但是例如在这里，它说了太多尝试。
But down here, for instance, it says too many attempts.

670
00:33:25,299 --> 00:33:26,011
稍后再试。
Try again later.

671
00:33:26,011 --> 00:33:28,719
我的意思是，这有点令人生气，因为如果我拿起手机
I mean, that's a little infuriating because if I pick up my phone

672
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,130
现在，我想现在就进入。
now, I want to get in now.

673
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:31,660
好吧，什么时候以后呢？
Well, when the heck is later?

674
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:35,600
撇开这个，这有什么好处呢？
So putting that aside, what's the takeaway here?

675
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:39,004
为什么选择Apple，为什么选择Google？
Why are Apple and why are Google doing this?

676
00:33:39,005 --> 00:33:42,130
因为我敢打赌大家，如果您曾经将自己锁定在手机之外，
Because I bet all of you, if you've ever locked yourself out of your phone,

677
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:45,280
在那一刻超级生气，也许没有
are super annoyed at that moment in time and probably don't

678
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,279
感谢苹果或谷歌。
appreciate Apple or Google.

679
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,029
但是他们刚刚拥有的好处是什么
But what's the upside of what they've just

680
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:53,349
当他们将您锁定在手机之外时完成
done when they lock you out of your phone for having

681
00:33:53,349 --> 00:33:56,799
猜错密码了吗？
guessed your password incorrectly?

682
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:00,459
为什么这可以说是功能而不是错误，错误？
Why is this arguably a feature and not a bug, a mistake?

683
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,090
山姆？
Sam?

684
00:34:01,089 --> 00:34:04,894
萨姆：是的，它用来减少成功使用蛮力的机会
SAM: Yeah, it's used to decrease the chances of a successful brute force

685
00:34:04,894 --> 00:34:05,394
攻击。
attack.

686
00:34:05,394 --> 00:34:08,978
戴维·J·马兰（David J. MALAN）：那会如何减少这种机会呢？
DAVID J. MALAN: And how does it decrease the chance of that, would you say?

687
00:34:08,978 --> 00:34:15,309
SAM：因为这使攻击者必须在尝试之前进行更多尝试
SAM: Because it makes the attacker have to commit more tries before they

688
00:34:15,309 --> 00:34:17,379
可以成功进入电话。
can successfully get into the phone.

689
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,969
因此，它减少了机会。
So it decreases the chances.

690
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:20,090
戴维·J·马兰（David J. MALAN）：好的。
DAVID J. MALAN: Exactly.

691
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:22,840
因此，这是安全性中非常普遍的原则。
So this is a very common principle in security.

692
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:26,590
前面也指出，这只会使对手放慢脚步。
And it was pointed out earlier, too, just slow the adversary down.

693
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:28,760
我们不必重新考虑安全问题。
We don't have to rethink the problem of security.

694
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,060
我们不必重新设计密码。
We don't have to redesign passwords necessarily.

695
00:34:31,059 --> 00:34:33,218
但是我们应该使对手更难
But we should make it harder for the adversary

696
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:36,909
理想情况下登录，而不会让您和我更难登录
to log in, ideally, without making it harder for you and I to log

697
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:37,960
进入我们自己的设备。
in to our own devices.

698
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:41,650
因此，请考虑具有四个数字的最简单的密码。
So consider the simplest passcode that had four digits.

699
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:45,010
一个4位数的密码，有10,000种可能性。
A 4-digit passcode, there were 10,000 possibilities.

700
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:47,980
一台计算机，一个机器人可以很快地猜出所有这些。
A computer, a robot could guess all of those pretty quickly.

701
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:51,639
但是如果输入了错误的密码三遍后该怎么办
But what if after typing in the wrong passcode three times

702
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:55,780
也许是十次，也可能是几次，如果是iPhone或Android，该怎么办
or maybe ten times, some small number of times, what if the iPhone or Android

703
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:59,560
手机将您锁定了一分钟，就像刚才的iPhone一样？
phone locks you out for a minute, just like iPhone did a moment ago?

704
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:03,039
好吧，这可能意味着，即使只有10,000种可能性，
Well, that might mean, even though there's only 10,000 possibilities,

705
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:06,039
可能要花费对手10,000分钟
maybe it will take the adversary 10,000 minutes

706
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:10,819
跟踪密码，因为它们每次都会变慢
to track your password because they keep getting slowed down every time

707
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,070
他们输入了不正确的密码。
they type in an incorrect one.

708
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,403
也许不是一万。
And maybe it's not quite 10,000.

709
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:15,349
这就是其中的一些因素。
It's some factor of that.

710
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:17,019
但是您可以通过这种方式降低它们的速度。
But you can slow them down in that way.

711
00:35:17,019 --> 00:35:21,759
也许您有一个10个字符的密码，其中包含78个四千万位数的可能性。
Maybe you have a 10-character passcode with 78 quadrillion possibilities.

712
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,330
想象一下，电话只会让您减速1秒钟。
And imagine the phone just slows you down 1 second.

713
00:35:25,329 --> 00:35:28,119
也许您每秒只能输入一个密码。
Maybe you can only type in one passcode per second.

714
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:29,679
听起来挺快的。
That sounds pretty fast.

715
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:33,729
但是78万亿秒太长了。
But 78 quadrillion seconds is crazy long.

716
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:36,880
因此，即使是这种减速也可能很好
And so even that kind of slowdown might very well

717
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,580
足以将对手拒之门外。
be enough to keep the adversary out.

718
00:35:39,579 --> 00:35:43,397
因此，如果您实际上没有在任何设备上启用此功能，
And so if you don't have features like this enabled on, really, any device,

719
00:35:43,398 --> 00:35:44,440
你应该找他们。
you should look for them.

720
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,860
幸运的是，如今，它们往往为此进行了预配置。
Nowadays, thankfully, they tend to come pre-configured for this.

721
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,810
但是有一个缺点。
But there is a downside.

722
00:35:49,809 --> 00:35:50,996
有一个缺点。
There is a downside.

723
00:35:50,996 --> 00:35:53,079
您不应该只开启这些防御措施
You shouldn't just turn on these kinds of defenses

724
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:56,799
盲目的，因为保持此功能的不利之处是什么
blindly because what's the downside of keeping this feature enabled

725
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,950
或保持启用状态-
or leaving it enabled--

726
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:03,969
这些是相同的事情-或启用它（如果尚未启用）？
those are the same things-- or enabling it, if it's not already enabled?

727
00:36:03,969 --> 00:36:06,309
要明确的是，这里有什么缺点？
What's the downside here, to be clear?

728
00:36:06,309 --> 00:36:10,749
因为我们今天的建议都不会有100％的优势。
Because none of our advice today will be 100% a win.

729
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:11,500
大卫？
David?

730
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,779
戴维：好吧，如果您忘记了密码，
DAVID: Well, if you forget your password,

731
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:16,780
这意味着您需要花费更长的时间才能再次访问手机。
that means it's going to take longer for you to access your phone again.

732
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:20,140
DAVID J. MALAN：是的，这将带您，用户，设备的所有者，
DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah, it's going to take you, the user, the owner of the device,

733
00:36:20,139 --> 00:36:21,399
甚至更长的登录时间。
even longer to log in.

734
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:25,060
我也承认，我有几次没有一次将自己锁定在自己之外。
And I'll admit, too, I have on multiple occasions not locked myself out once.

735
00:36:25,059 --> 00:36:25,977
然后我变得固执。
I then got stubborn.

736
00:36:25,978 --> 00:36:27,520
而且我认为我的愤怒程度刚刚上升。
And I think my anger level just rose.

737
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:30,639
因此，我开始更加生气地输入内容，因此犯了更多的错误。
So I started typing in more angrily, and therefore making more mistakes.

738
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:33,069
苹果和谷歌所做的就是他们拥有
And what Apple and Google do is they have

739
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:35,380
您可能将其描述为指数补偿，
what you might describe as exponential backoff, which

740
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:38,847
这是一种奇特的说法，您第一次受到惩罚是一分钟。
is a fancy way of saying, the first time you get penalized one minute.

741
00:36:38,847 --> 00:36:40,180
现在您必须等待一分钟。
Now you have to wait one minute.

742
00:36:40,179 --> 00:36:43,029
如果再次拧紧，则必须等待两分钟。
If you screw up again, then you have to wait two minutes.

743
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:45,023
如果您再次搞砸了，也许是五分钟。
If you screw up again, maybe it's five minutes.

744
00:36:45,023 --> 00:36:45,940
也许是10分钟。
Maybe it's 10 minutes.

745
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:46,840
也许一个小时。
Maybe it's an hour.

746
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,715
我发誓，那时候我想把手机扔到整个房间
And I swear, at that point I wanted to throw my phone across the room

747
00:36:49,715 --> 00:36:51,700
因为我无法进入自己的设备。
because I couldn't get into my own device.

748
00:36:51,699 --> 00:36:55,839
在那里，您当然开始牺牲可用性了，对吗？
And there you start to sacrifice, of course, usability, right?

749
00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:00,190
如果我的设备非常安全，甚至连我都无法进入，
If my device is so secure that even I can't get into it,

750
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:02,080
那真的值得拥有吗？
then is it really worth having at all?

751
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,779
因此，发现拐点是其中的一部分
And so finding that inflection point is part

752
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:07,720
设计好的安全系统，因为您
of engineering good secure systems because you

753
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:10,149
必须找到拐点，以便您的用户
have to find that inflection point so that your users

754
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:12,190
正在使用良好的密码和密码。
are using good passwords and passcodes.

755
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:16,300
但是，他们不只是将其贴在便利贴上的显示器上
But they're not just taping them onto the monitor on a Post-It note

756
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,123
或一起禁用它们。
or disabling them all together.

757
00:37:19,123 --> 00:37:21,040
好吧，让我在这里停留看看
All right, let me pause here to see, are there

758
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:27,309
有关密码，密码，暴力破解或此类问题
any questions about passwords, passcodes, brute forcing or these kinds

759
00:37:27,309 --> 00:37:30,549
防御，因为密码可能是
of defenses, given that passwords are perhaps

760
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:33,520
我们最常见的防御对手
our most common defense against adversaries

761
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:36,879
访问我们不希望他们使用的硬件和软件？
accessing hardware and software that we don't want them to?

762
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,485
是的，达克斯，有问题吗？
Yeah, Dax, question?

763
00:37:38,485 --> 00:37:40,720
DAX：现在有一个确定的数字
DAX: Now so there is a definite number we

764
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:43,239
可以计算出4位数字
can calculate that for 4-digit numbers this is

765
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:46,119
尽可能多的结果。
the most possible number of outcomes.

766
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:47,917
但是生物识别法呢？
But what about biometrics?

767
00:37:47,918 --> 00:37:48,460
指纹？
Fingerprints?

768
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,845
脸部扫描？
Face scanning?

769
00:37:49,844 --> 00:37:51,709
DAVID J. MALAN：好的，这是一个很好的问题。
DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah, really good question.

770
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,950
那么使用面部扫描进行生物识别又如何呢？
So what about biometrics, using face scanning?

771
00:37:53,949 --> 00:37:58,396
像是，这些天苹果有面部识别码，有时也让我烦恼
Like, Apple has face ID these days, which also annoys me sometimes

772
00:37:58,396 --> 00:37:59,979
如果这还不能完全正确地表达我的意思。
if it doesn't quite get my face right.

773
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,230
或者这些天，如果我们戴着口罩，那是
Or these days if we're wearing masks, it's

774
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,910
气愤地使用这种功能。
infuriating to use that kind of feature.

775
00:38:03,909 --> 00:38:07,934
但也许是概率性的，很少有人拥有完全相同的
But maybe probabilistically, there are fewer people with exactly

776
00:38:07,934 --> 00:38:09,559
你的面部特征比别人强。
your facial features than someone else.

777
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:12,059
因此，这比选择一些密码更安全。
And so that would be more secure than picking some passcode.

778
00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:14,769
有时您使用指纹或视网膜扫描
Sometimes you use fingerprints or retinal scans

779
00:38:14,769 --> 00:38:17,649
或手指之间的距离，所有这些不同的量度
or the distance between your fingers, all of these different measures

780
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:21,850
从统计上讲并没有那么独特
that statistically tend to not so much uniquely

781
00:38:21,849 --> 00:38:25,507
识别我们，但足以唯一地识别我们。
identify us, but uniquely identify us all enough.

782
00:38:25,507 --> 00:38:26,799
那里也有威胁。
And there's threats there, too.

783
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,508
例如，我们的前同事
A former colleague of ours, for instance,

784
00:38:28,507 --> 00:38:31,089
有一个双胞胎兄弟，因为苹果的脸蛋
had a twin brother who because of Apple's face ID

785
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:34,330
现在可以从桌子上拿起手机进入他的手机
was now able to get into his phone by just picking it up off of the table

786
00:38:34,329 --> 00:38:36,979
因为作为双胞胎，他们看上去都太相似了。
because as twins, they both looked all too similar.

787
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,580
因此，也有缺点和优点。
So there's downsides and upsides there, too.

788
00:38:39,579 --> 00:38:42,069
但是生物识别技术也可以帮助解决问题，
But biometrics can also help things so that it's

789
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:45,130
一直存在于您身上的因素，而不是某些因素，
a factor you have on you always and not something,

790
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:48,010
例如，您只需要记住。
for instance, that you just only have to remember.

791
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:51,520
实际上，对于计算机科学家来说，这是一个完美的选择
And in fact, that's a perfect segue to what computer scientists

792
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:54,216
调用两因素身份验证。
call two-factor authentication.

793
00:38:54,217 --> 00:38:56,050
在安全世界中，安全人员会
In the security world, security people would

794
00:38:56,050 --> 00:39:01,070
称我们使用的密码是一个因素
call the passwords we're using one factor, and something

795
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:03,380
就像生物识别一样，第二个因素。
like biometrics, a second factor.

796
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:06,350
实际上，两因素身份验证意味着一种防御机制
And indeed, two-factor authentication means a defense mechanism

797
00:39:06,349 --> 00:39:09,049
对抗不仅仅依赖某事的对手
against the adversaries that doesn't rely just on something

798
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:10,970
您知道，例如密码。
you know, like, a password.

799
00:39:10,969 --> 00:39:14,539
它还依赖于您通常拥有的东西，例如，
It also relies on something typically that you have, like,

800
00:39:14,539 --> 00:39:18,569
手，手指，眼睛或脸等
a hand or fingers or eyes or face or the like,

801
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:21,980
这样即使有人泄露了您的密码
so that even if someone compromises your password

802
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:25,490
并将其从以前使用过的数据库中下载到某个地方，
and downloads it somewhere from a database where you've used it before,

803
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:28,489
他们不一定能接触到您的眼睛和手
they don't necessarily have access to your eyes and your hands

804
00:39:28,489 --> 00:39:31,499
以及您的脸庞等，除非他们对您有身体上的帮助。
and your face and the like, unless they have physical access to you.

805
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,680
因此，它只是缩小了威胁的范围。
So it just narrows the scope of the threats.

806
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:35,899
但是还有其他形式的两因素身份验证。
But there's other forms of two-factor authentication.

807
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,718
例如，如果现在听起来很熟悉，也许
For instance, if this sounds familiar now, and maybe

808
00:39:38,717 --> 00:39:40,759
您甚至不称其为两因素身份验证。
you don't even call it two-factor authentication.

809
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,970
通常称为两步身份验证。
It's often called two-step authentication.

810
00:39:43,969 --> 00:39:47,209
通过举手示意，谁拥有一个或多个账户，
By a show of physical hands, who has one or more accounts that

811
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:51,000
使用两个因素而不是一个？
uses two factors instead of just one?

812
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,350
是的，在这里也很高兴看到这么多手举起。
Yeah, so here, too, it's good to see so many hands going up.

813
00:39:54,349 --> 00:39:58,369
但是，如果您不使用两因素身份验证
But if you do not use two-factor authentication

814
00:39:58,369 --> 00:40:03,169
用于诸如您的电子邮件帐户，银行帐户或经纪人之类的事情
for things like your email account or your bank accounts or your brokerage

815
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:06,830
帐户或您的健康医疗帐户，
accounts or your health medical accounts,

816
00:40:06,829 --> 00:40:09,109
您确实应该开始考虑这样做。
you really should start considering doing so.

817
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,880
而且通常采用什么形式？
And what form does this typically take?

818
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,963
好吧，例如，让我在这里显示一个屏幕截图。
Well, let me show a screenshot here, for instance.

819
00:40:12,963 --> 00:40:14,930
即使您只有一个简单的Gmail帐户
Even if you just have a simple Gmail account

820
00:40:14,929 --> 00:40:17,569
您用于工作或个人用途的
that you use for work or for personal use,

821
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:20,480
您可以启用Google所谓的两步验证，即
you can enable what Google calls two-step verification, which

822
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,360
是双重身份验证。
is two-factor authentication.

823
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,860
以及登录Gmail时会提示您的内容
And what you'll be prompted for when logging into your Gmail

824
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:29,250
帐户（如果启用），不仅是您的用户名和密码，
account if you enable this is not only your username and your password,

825
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:31,070
也是一个6位数的代码。
but also a 6-digit code.

826
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:33,710
六位数听起来并不长。
And six digits doesn't sound terribly long.

827
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:36,620
但是在这种情况下，这些技术通常的工作方式
But in this case, the way these technologies typically work

828
00:40:36,619 --> 00:40:42,199
是通过电子邮件或短信向您发送一次6位数代码
is that you are sent that 6-digit code once via email or via text message

829
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:46,009
或通过您在手机或其他设备上安装的特殊应用
or via special app that you install on your phone or some other device

830
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:48,170
这样只有您有该代码。
so that only you have that code.

831
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:50,060
只有您拥有该设备。
Only you have that device.

832
00:40:50,059 --> 00:40:51,799
因此，只有您知道该代码。
And therefore, only you know that code.

833
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,380
而且更好的是，这些代码会过期。
And better yet, these codes expire.

834
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:57,770
因此，即使某些对手拦截了它或看到您在键入它
So even if some adversary intercepts it or sees you typing it

835
00:40:57,769 --> 00:41:00,559
在您的肩膀上，您只能使用一次这些代码，
in over your shoulder, you can only use these codes once,

836
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:02,749
这使它们比密码更好
which makes them even better than passwords

837
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:06,680
单独使用，因为它们在单次使用后会过期。
alone because they expire after single time use.

838
00:41:06,679 --> 00:41:08,449
因此，现在再考虑-
And so consider now, again--

839
00:41:08,449 --> 00:41:10,399
我不能强调这一点-如果您
and I can't emphasize this enough-- if you

840
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,242
同样，您拥有自己的银行帐户的年龄，
are of the age where you have your own bank accounts, again,

841
00:41:13,242 --> 00:41:15,200
经纪账户，任何与医学有关的，
brokerage accounts, anything medically related,

842
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:17,599
您发现特别重要或个人的任何事物，
anything that you find especially important or personal,

843
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:21,829
例如您自己的电子邮件或聊天帐户，如果您仅使用密码，
like, your own email or chat accounts, if you're only using a password,

844
00:41:21,829 --> 00:41:24,919
截止到今天，您已经拥有数学工具
you now as of today already have the mathematical tools

845
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:28,010
我敢说，心智模型要弄清楚
and the mental model, I daresay, to figure out just

846
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:32,780
有人可以轻易地破坏您的帐户并获取您的信息的难易程度
how easily someone could compromise your account and get into your information

847
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:35,637
并拿走您的钱或阅读您的电子邮件等。
and take your money or read your emails or the like.

848
00:41:35,637 --> 00:41:38,720
因此，您可以通过提出更好的，更长的时间来改善这种情况，
So you can improve that situation by just coming up with a better, longer,

849
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:42,409
您会以某种方式记住或记住的更多随机密码，
more random password that you remember or memorize in some way,

850
00:41:42,409 --> 00:41:46,819
或另外，通过启用第二个因素，使您缩小
or additionally, by enabling the second factor so that you narrow

851
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:52,710
结果对您构成威胁的威胁数量。
the number of threats that are dangerous to you as a result.

852
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:55,112
如此说来，通过两因素身份验证，
So with that said, too, with two-factor authentication,

853
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:57,320
还有另一件事可以让您发挥作用
there's another thing you can bring into play when it

854
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,810
来管理您的所有密码。
comes to managing all your passwords.

855
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:03,229
我曾暗示过使用Microsoft Word或便利贴。
I alluded to using Microsoft Word before or a Post-It note.

856
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:05,970
也有对此的软件解决方案。
There are software solutions to this, too.

857
00:42:05,969 --> 00:42:09,319
因此，我们今天想提出另一项抗辩供您考虑
So another defense we would like to offer up for your consideration today

858
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,510
通常称为密码管理器。
is what's generally called a password manager.

859
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:14,645
这是一款免费的软件，您也可以付费购买，
This is a piece of software, either for free or that you pay for,

860
00:42:14,644 --> 00:42:17,299
对于您的手机，笔记本电脑或台式机，
for your phone or your laptop or desktop, that

861
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,160
从字面上管理您的密码。
literally manages your passwords.

862
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:23,749
以最简单的形式，将其视为电子表格，但这是“安全的”，
In its simplest form, think of it like a spreadsheet, but that's "secure,"

863
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,669
在您自己的计算机上引用unquote。
quote unquote, on your own computer.

864
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:28,970
也就是说，这些密码管理器-这是两个流行的密码管理器。
That is, these password managers-- and here's two popular ones.

865
00:42:28,969 --> 00:42:33,482
onepassword.com是一种流行的工具。 lastpass.com是另一个。
onepassword.com is one popular tool. lastpass.com is another one.

866
00:42:33,483 --> 00:42:35,150
还有其他人，如果您在Google周围搜索。
And there's others if you google around.

867
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:37,970
但是，我将一如既往地阅读评论或获得第二意见。
But I would, as always, read up on reviews or get second opinions.

868
00:42:37,969 --> 00:42:40,159
不要仅仅看我们提出的建议。
Don't just take at face value what we propose.

869
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:42,619
但是这些密码管理器是您可以使用的程序
But these password managers are programs that you

870
00:42:42,619 --> 00:42:45,919
输入您的用户名和密码。
type your usernames and passwords into.

871
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:52,040
然后将它们全部保存在一个主密码后面，
And then you save them all behind one master password, one password that's

872
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:54,649
真的很长，希望真的很随机
really long, hopefully, really random with lots

873
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:56,210
数字，字母和符号的集合。
of numbers and letters and symbols.

874
00:42:56,210 --> 00:43:00,710
但是您只需要记住一个主密码即可。
But all you have to remember is that one main password.

875
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:04,040
然后通过在Mac或PC或手机中输入该密码，
And by entering that password into your Mac or PC or phone,

876
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:06,229
然后，您可以解锁所有其他帐户。
you then unlock all of your other accounts.

877
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:09,920
然后，您可以复制并粘贴您实际帐户的用户名
And you can then just copy and paste your actual accounts' usernames

878
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,725
和密码。
and passwords.

879
00:43:10,724 --> 00:43:12,849
或者这些程序也为您提供键盘快捷键。
Or these programs also give you keyboard shortcuts.

880
00:43:12,849 --> 00:43:16,429
所以您按下键盘命令，瞧，您会自动
So you hit a keyboard command, and voila, you're automatically

881
00:43:16,429 --> 00:43:17,419
登录网站。
logged into websites.

882
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:20,000
您不必复制/粘贴或手动转录它们。
You don't have to copy/paste or manually transcribe them.

883
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,860
那么到今天，这意味着什么呢？
So to this day, what does this mean?

884
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:24,230
对于我来说，我使用这些密码管理器之一。
For me, I use one of these password managers.

885
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:25,980
我的大多数同事也这样做。
And most of my colleagues do as well.

886
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:29,660
我们很多人，大多数人甚至都不知道密码
Many of us, most of us, don't even know the passwords

887
00:43:29,659 --> 00:43:32,959
我们用于各种网站或应用程序等。
we use for various websites or apps or the like.

888
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:33,590
为什么？
Why?

889
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:35,780
因为我们现在相信密码管理器
Because we now trust that the password manager

890
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:39,710
只需单击一个按钮，就可以生成一个很长的随机密码
can, with the click of a button, generate a really long random password

891
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:41,870
有很多数字，数字和标点符号。
with lots of numbers, digits, and punctuation.

892
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:44,509
然后它将为我记住它。
And then it will remember it for me.

893
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:47,870
我只需要记住一个主要的密码是
And I just have to remember that one main password that's

894
00:43:47,869 --> 00:43:50,429
保护所有其他人。
protecting all of those others.

895
00:43:50,429 --> 00:43:54,889
这样很好，因为我现在可以练习我一直在讲的东西。
So that's good in that now I can practice what I've been preaching.

896
00:43:54,889 --> 00:43:58,329
但是有一个缺点。
But there is a downside.

897
00:43:58,329 --> 00:44:01,419
我正面临新的风险或脆弱性。
I'm exposing myself to a new risk or vulnerability.

898
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:03,760
也就是说，这里的权衡是什么？
That is to say, what's the trade-off here?

899
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,360
为什么你不必在今天的课后刚跑完，
Why should you not necessarily just run off after today's class,

900
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:11,260
下载并安装密码管理器，然后开始使用它
download and install a password manager, and start using it

901
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:13,990
首先没有一点想法。
without a little bit of thought first.

902
00:44:13,989 --> 00:44:17,079
不利之处可能是什么？
What's the downside, perhaps?

903
00:44:17,079 --> 00:44:23,579
是的，如果我说对了，请转到Lexlene？
Yeah, over to Lexlene if I'm saying it right?

904
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:30,389
LEXLENE：是的，如果有人破解了您的密码管理器密码，
LEXLENE: Yeah, if someone cracks your password manager password,

905
00:44:30,389 --> 00:44:32,839
那么他们就可以访问您的所有密码。
then they have access to all your passwords.

906
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:35,893
DAVID J. MALAN：是的，所以这实际上取决于这里所面临的威胁，
DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah, so really depends on what the threat here is,

907
00:44:35,893 --> 00:44:37,310
或您最担心的是什么。
or what you're most worried about.

908
00:44:37,309 --> 00:44:39,349
如果有人妥协，猜测，弄清楚
If someone compromises, guesses, figures out

909
00:44:39,349 --> 00:44:41,969
您的主要密码可以保护所有其他密码，
your main password that protects all of the others,

910
00:44:41,969 --> 00:44:44,569
现在您只需一次将所有帐户交给他们。
now you've just handed them all of your accounts at once.

911
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:46,590
这是一个巨大的权衡。
And that's a massive trade-off.

912
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:48,980
但是，如果您再次考虑替代方案，
However, if you again consider the alternative,

913
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:53,090
拿出大的随机密码，然后全部记住或全部记住
coming up with big random passwords and then memorizing them all, or somewhat

914
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:55,010
愚蠢地将它们写下在便利贴上
foolishly, writing them down on a Post-It note

915
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:56,843
并把它放在显示器上
and putting it on your monitor, the question

916
00:44:56,842 --> 00:45:02,449
这不是做事的正确方法，
shouldn't be is this the right way to do things,

917
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:05,701
但实际上，相对而言，这是一种更好的做事方式吗？
but really, relatively speaking, is this a better way to do things?

918
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:07,910
因此，您总是容易受到某些风险的影响。
So you're always going to be vulnerable to some risk.

919
00:45:07,909 --> 00:45:09,589
您担心哪些风险？
Which of those risks do you worry about?

920
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:12,380
也许您可以通过减轻这种担忧
And maybe you can mitigate that concern by maybe

921
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:15,920
您可以为密码管理员写下您的主密码
you could write down your main password for your password manager

922
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:20,390
并可能将其放入物理保险库或防火柜等中
and maybe put it in a physical vault or a fire locker or the like

923
00:45:20,389 --> 00:45:23,259
别人很少有机会接触到的机会，
that with very low probability someone else would get access to,

924
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:25,010
除非他们物理攻击该设备，
unless they physically attack that device,

925
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:27,960
或将其隐藏在书架上的书本之类的地方。
or hide it somewhere in a book on your shelf or the like.

926
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,510
所以是的，它很脆弱。
So that yes, it's vulnerable.

927
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:33,140
但是有人发现它的几率可能相对较低。
But the odds that someone finds it might just be relatively low.

928
00:45:33,139 --> 00:45:35,629
但这又是主题，要弄清楚
But again, this is the theme, figuring out

929
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:39,170
您的帐户和证券类型的正确余额是多少
what the right balance is for your accounts and the type of security

930
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:42,140
您想要实现的目标。
that you want to aspire to achieve.

931
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:43,889
好吧，让我们考虑其他一些防御措施。
Well, let's consider a few other defenses.

932
00:45:43,889 --> 00:45:46,931
我们会在最后留下一些时间来询问有关特定工具的问题
And we'll leave time at the very end for questions about particular tools

933
00:45:46,931 --> 00:45:47,631
和技术。
and techniques.

934
00:45:47,632 --> 00:45:49,340
我们可以建立的另一个构建基块是什么
What's another building block that we can

935
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:52,310
在网上保护自己方面承担责任吗？
bring to bear when it comes to protecting ourselves online?

936
00:45:52,309 --> 00:45:55,849
因此，加密-CS50的学生将再次知道加密是指
So encryption-- CS50 students will know that encryption refers, again,

937
00:45:55,849 --> 00:46:01,009
扰乱信息，使数据看起来像是随机数据，
to the scrambling of information, making data look like it's random data,

938
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:05,000
但是通过使用所谓的密钥（通常是只有您自己的密钥）进行加密
but by encrypting it with what's called the key, typically, a key that only you

939
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,889
和接收者以某种方式知道。
and the recipient somehow know.

940
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:10,069
加密往往是我们许多问题的解决方案。
Encryption tends to be the solution to a lot of our problems.

941
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:12,650
实际上，这些密码管理器通常
And indeed, these password managers typically

942
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:17,150
进一步加密您的数据，以便即使有人窃取了您的Mac和PC
additionally encrypt your data so that even someone who steals your Mac and PC

943
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:19,370
不能只是打开程序并查看它。
can't just open up the program and see it.

944
00:46:19,369 --> 00:46:21,619
所有的数据也同样被加密。
All of the data, too, is similarly encrypted.

945
00:46:21,619 --> 00:46:26,029
你们中的许多人已经受到社会的训练或适应，至少要看
Many of you have already been trained or conditioned by society to at least look

946
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:30,815
为或希望或认可https：//。
for or hope for or recognize https://.

947
00:46:30,815 --> 00:46:32,425
s表示安全。
The s means secure.

948
00:46:32,425 --> 00:46:34,550
那往往是一件好事，因为这意味着
That just tends to be a good thing because it means

949
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:36,290
您正在访问的网站是安全的。
a website you're visiting is secure.

950
00:46:36,289 --> 00:46:39,829
它是加密的，而不是http，它是加密的
It's encrypted, as opposed to just http, which

951
00:46:39,829 --> 00:46:43,619
就在几年前变得更加普遍，并且完全未加密。
was much more common just a few years ago and is completely unencrypted.

952
00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:48,259
也就是说，如果您访问的网址中仅包含http的网站，
So that is to say if you visit a website that says just http in the URL, anyone

953
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:51,960
从理论上讲，您和该网站之间可以进行监听，
between you and that website theoretically can be listening in,

954
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:55,460
可以这么说，在您的流量中，零点和来回的零。
so to speak, on your traffic, the zeros and ones going back and forth.

955
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:57,410
任何人都可以看到您正在访问的页面。
Anyone can see what pages you're visiting.

956
00:46:57,409 --> 00:47:00,259
如果您在国外访问敏感材料，
If you're in some foreign country visiting sensitive materials,

957
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:02,840
政府可以知道您正在访问哪些网站
the government could know what websites you're visiting

958
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:05,400
以及您正在阅读的内容。
and what content, for instance, you're reading.

959
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,940
https变得更难了。
https makes that much harder.

960
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:09,080
不是100％。
It's not 100%.

961
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:10,939
仍然有可能发生攻击。
There are attacks still that are possible.

962
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:12,800
但同样，它只是提高了标准。
But again, it just raises the bar.

963
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,667
但是还有另一种技术正在越来越多
But there's another technique that's increasingly

964
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:18,499
在媒体上进行讨论，并且您应该熟悉这些内容，
being discussed in the media, and with which you should be familiar,

965
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,689
被称为端到端加密。
known as end-to-end encryption.

966
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:24,890
端到端加密意味着当您使用第三方服务时，
End-to-end encryption means that when you're using a third-party service,

967
00:47:24,889 --> 00:47:27,979
通常，无论是聊天服务，视频会议
typically, whether it's a chat service, a video conferencing

968
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:30,320
服务或类似服务，您不仅在加密
service or the like, you're not just encrypting

969
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:33,590
您之间的流量，零和一
your traffic, the zeros and ones, between you

970
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:39,020
Google，您和Microsoft，您和Amazon或其他一些第三方。
and Google, you and Microsoft, you and Amazon, or some other third-party.

971
00:47:39,019 --> 00:47:43,309
您正在加密您和与之交谈的人之间的数据。
You are encrypting your data between you and the person you're talking to.

972
00:47:43,309 --> 00:47:46,579
因此，例如WhatsApp，即流行的消息传递工具，
So WhatsApp, for instance, the popular messaging tool,

973
00:47:46,579 --> 00:47:48,139
早期具有此功能。
early on had this feature.

974
00:47:48,139 --> 00:47:50,669
如今还有许多其他聊天程序也有它，
And many other chat programs nowadays have it as well,

975
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:54,805
包括iMessage，Signal和Telegram等。
including iMessage and Signal and Telegram and the like.

976
00:47:54,804 --> 00:47:56,929
端到端加密意味着即使您
End-to-end encryption means that even though you're

977
00:47:56,929 --> 00:48:01,519
使用第三方服务，您可能会或可能不会信任的公司，
using a third-party service, a company that you may or may not trust,

978
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:06,049
您的交流是在您和对方之间进行的
your communications are communicated between you and the person

979
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:08,190
与您交谈的人。
with whom you're speaking.

980
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:12,260
中间的公司，他们的服务器，即使您的数据正在通过
The company in between, their servers, even though your data is going through

981
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:15,530
他们的服务器无法解密该信息。
their servers, cannot decrypt that information.

982
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:18,232
他们看不到原始格式的信息。
They cannot see the information in its raw form.

983
00:48:18,231 --> 00:48:19,189
所以这是一件好事。
So that's a good thing.

984
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,140
因此，WhatsApp也可以做到这一点。
So WhatsApp does this, too.

985
00:48:23,139 --> 00:48:28,099
Zoom类至少在最近才这样做。
Zoom kind of does this, at least, only recently does this.

986
00:48:28,099 --> 00:48:31,029
以Zoom为例，例如我们目前正在使用的技术，
So Zoom, for instance, the technology that we are all using right now,

987
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:33,580
实际上花了一些时间，对了，几个月
actually took some flak, rightly so, some months

988
00:48:33,579 --> 00:48:36,699
回想一下，当我回想起他们网站上的营销文献时，
back, when in their marketing literature on their website, as I recall,

989
00:48:36,699 --> 00:48:40,509
广告宣传Zoom提供端到端加密，
advertised Zoom as offering end-to-end encryption, which

990
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:43,750
是错误的，因为端到端加密的意思是，
was false because what end-to-end encryption means is,

991
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:47,620
正如我所描述的，在您和您与之交流的人之间。
as I described it, between you and the person with whom you're communicating.

992
00:48:47,619 --> 00:48:50,889
但是当时的营销文献是
But the marketing literature at the time was

993
00:48:50,889 --> 00:48:53,409
指的是你们之间的端到端加密
referring to end-to-end encryption between you

994
00:48:53,409 --> 00:48:57,429
和Zoom，这不是安全研究人员或计算机科学家所需要的
and Zoom, which is not what security researchers or computer scientists

995
00:48:57,429 --> 00:49:00,969
或一般而言，技术人员都会将端到端加密定义为。
or technologists in general would define end-to-end encryption as.

996
00:49:00,969 --> 00:49:03,129
因此，他们为此采取了一些措施，这是正确的。
And so they took some flak for that, rightly so.

997
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:05,650
他们已经开始了，不过最近几周开始推广
They've begun, though, in recent weeks, rolling out

998
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:08,140
实际的端到端加密。
actual end-to-end encryption.

999
00:49:08,139 --> 00:49:10,269
我们现在不使用它。
We are not using it right now.

1000
00:49:10,269 --> 00:49:12,879
实际上，这使某些功能难以使用。
It actually makes certain features harder to use.

1001
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,530
因此，这也是一个折衷方案。
So there, too, there's a trade-off.

1002
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:17,590
但总的来说，如果您是最亲密或最私密的人
But generally speaking, if you're having the most intimate or private

1003
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:22,150
或与人沟通的个人，财务或医疗方面的信息，
or personal or financial or medical of communications with people,

1004
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:27,010
这是您应该开始寻找，聆听和期待的另一个功能
this is another feature you should start to look for and listen for and expect

1005
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:28,810
您正在使用的工具。
of the tools that you're using.

1006
00:49:28,809 --> 00:49:32,439
特别是在涉及各国的审查制度时
And especially when it comes to censorship in various countries

1007
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,290
和社区，这是一种软件
and communities, this is the kind of software

1008
00:49:35,289 --> 00:49:37,329
越来越多地受到政府的攻击
that's increasingly under attack by governments

1009
00:49:37,329 --> 00:49:42,729
因为他们经常想要借壳，所以美国的国家安全局（NSA）或联邦调查局（FBI）
because they often want backdoor so that the USA's NSA or FBI

1010
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:45,130
或其他实体可以参与这些交流。
or some other entity can get into these communications.

1011
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:47,650
从好的方面讲，这变得更加困难，
That's made much more difficult, in a good way,

1012
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:53,170
通过使用端到端加密来确保您的通信确实安全。
by using end-to-end encryption so that your communications are indeed secure.

1013
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:56,757
好吧，在我们最后的时刻，让我们最终专注于Zoom，
Well, in our final moments together, let's focus ultimately on Zoom,

1014
00:49:56,757 --> 00:49:58,090
我们正在使用的技术。
the very technology we're using.

1015
00:49:58,090 --> 00:49:59,950
因为他们拍了一些战利品
Because they've taken some flak, certainly

1016
00:49:59,949 --> 00:50:02,824
除了您可能从未听说过的端到端加密之外，
beyond end-to-end encryption, which you might not have even heard of,

1017
00:50:02,824 --> 00:50:04,209
就像没有安全感一样。
as just being insecure.

1018
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:06,640
还有很多学校系统，很多用户
And a lot of school systems, a lot of users

1019
00:50:06,639 --> 00:50:09,679
由于这个原因，几个月前决定停止使用Zoom，
decided some months ago to stop using Zoom for this reason,

1020
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:12,039
即使他们的业务仍在蓬勃发展。
even though their business is still booming.

1021
00:50:12,039 --> 00:50:13,629
那么Zoom安全吗？
So is Zoom secure?

1022
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:15,640
让我们问这个小组的最后一个问题
Let's ask one final question of the group

1023
00:50:15,639 --> 00:50:19,689
在这里，请记住，我们现在刚刚花了一个小时来讨论
here, keeping in mind that we've now just spent the past hour discussing

1024
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:21,250
安全主题。
topics of security.

1025
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:23,990
让我继续在这里问最后一个问题，
Let me go ahead and ask this final question here,

1026
00:50:23,989 --> 00:50:26,919
一会儿就会出现在您的屏幕上。
which will appear on your screen in just a moment.

1027
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:32,450
很简单，缩放安全吗？
It is quite simply, is Zoom secure?

1028
00:50:32,449 --> 00:50:34,859
好吧，让我们看看响应是如何进入的。
All right, let's see how the responses are coming in.

1029
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:41,690
我看到55％否，16％是，28％（不确定）。
I'm seeing 55% no, 16% yes, 28%, unsure.

1030
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:43,070
所以在那里合理传播。
So a reasonable spread there.

1031
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:44,780
让我们在这里发表一些意见。
Let's take a couple of comments here.

1032
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:50,120
在那些认为Zoom是安全的人中，为什么您认为它是安全的？
Among those of you who think Zoom is secure, why do you think it's secure?

1033
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:54,079
任何人都愿意举起虚拟手，以便我们可以致电给您，
Would anyone be comfortable raising a virtual hand so we can call on you,

1034
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:58,489
或在聊天中评论为什么您认为Zoom安全可靠？
or maybe commenting in the chat as to why you think Zoom is secure?

1035
00:50:58,489 --> 00:51:01,639
让我们看看，Sam，怎么样？
Let's see, over to, how about, Sam?

1036
00:51:01,639 --> 00:51:02,389
你怎么认为？
What do you think?

1037
00:51:02,389 --> 00:51:07,759
SAM：两天前，Zoom为所有用户提供了端到端加密。
SAM: Two days ago, Zoom offered end-to-end encryption to all the users.

1038
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,730
DAVID J. MALAN：是的，事实上，那是及时的。
DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah, so it was, in fact, that timely.

1039
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:12,497
Zoom开始试行，
Zoom began rolling out, on a trial basis,

1040
00:51:12,496 --> 00:51:14,579
本质上是所有用户的端到端加密。
essentially, end-to-end encryption with all users.

1041
00:51:14,579 --> 00:51:18,289
因此，如果您正在使用它，并且-这也是关键-
So if you are using that, and-- and this is key, too--

1042
00:51:18,289 --> 00:51:22,309
Zoom正确地实现了这个概念，
and Zoom has implemented that concept correctly,

1043
00:51:22,309 --> 00:51:24,919
然后，是的，也许Zoom在某种意义上是安全的
then, yes, maybe Zoom is secure in the sense

1044
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,470
您与其他人的视频对话
that your video conversation with someone else

1045
00:51:27,469 --> 00:51:29,959
实际上，您和他们之间是私人的。
is in fact private between you and them.

1046
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:34,370
话虽如此，如果您在咖啡店或图书馆，至少
With that said, if you're in a coffee shop or in a library, at least

1047
00:51:34,369 --> 00:51:37,579
在更健康的时代，有人在看望或聆听
in healthier times, and someone's looking over or listening

1048
00:51:37,579 --> 00:51:41,079
在您的对话中，可以说甚至是技术也不安全。
in on your conversation, arguably even that technology is not secure.

1049
00:51:41,079 --> 00:51:42,829
您可以想象还有其他威胁。
You can imagine there being other threats.

1050
00:51:42,829 --> 00:51:47,569
也许您不小心受到了某种病毒的攻击
Maybe you have accidentally been vulnerable to a virus, some kind

1051
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:49,067
您自己的计算机上的威胁。
of threat on your own computer.

1052
00:51:49,067 --> 00:51:50,900
即使，是的，您的数据也已加密
And even though, yes, your data is encrypted

1053
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:53,480
在你和另一个人之间
between you and that other person, that doesn't

1054
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:56,420
表示您的个人Mac上没有运行恶意软件
mean there's not malicious software running on your own personal Mac

1055
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:59,630
或PC或其他人的计算机，记录所有内容
or PC or the other person's, recording everything

1056
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:02,750
您说并将其上传到某些第三方对手。
you say and uploading it to some third-party adversary.

1057
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:06,950
因此，无论何时问或回答有关安全性的问题，
So there, too, whenever you ask or answer questions about security,

1058
00:52:06,949 --> 00:52:09,799
考虑到这些资格，
take into account those kinds of qualifications,

1059
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:14,383
这些条件，因为安全永远不应该
those conditionals, because security should never

1060
00:52:14,382 --> 00:52:15,799
在真空中进行讨论。
be discussed, really, in a vacuum.

1061
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:19,550
因此，那些谁说不，我认为我们可以提出更多的理由。
So those of you who said no, I think we could come up with even more reasons.

1062
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:23,000
但是至少让我消除一些，因为我确实认为有些弱点
But at least let me dispel just a few because I do think some of the flak

1063
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,299
Zoom被夸大了，因为那些批评并没有真正
Zoom took was overstated because those criticizing didn't really

1064
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:29,860
了解在媒体上吹捧的一些问题。
understand some of the issues that were being touted in the media.

1065
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:36,050
例如，今天你们所有人要登录此会议，
So for instance, all of you today, to log into this meeting, for instance,

1066
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:38,810
跟随一个URL（很可能是通过电子邮件发送给您）
followed a URL, most likely, that you had been emailed

1067
00:52:38,809 --> 00:52:40,159
或您在屏幕上看到的内容。
or that you saw on your screen.

1068
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:44,629
该URL可能看起来像这样-https：//，
And that URL probably looked a little something like this-- https://,

1069
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:48,620
zoom.us或类似的东西，再加上一个数字，这是很好的
which is good, zoom.us or something like that, followed by a number,

1070
00:52:48,619 --> 00:52:49,699
会议ID--
the meeting ID--

1071
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:52,249
例如5551112222。
for instance, 5551112222.

1072
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:55,560
但这对今天的会议来说是一个不同的数字。
But it was a different number for today's meeting.

1073
00:52:55,559 --> 00:52:58,969
因此，如果您在注册后收到此URL，它是否安全？
So if you received this URL after registering, is it secure?

1074
00:52:58,969 --> 00:53:02,869
好吧，即使现在你们所有人都已经注册了，
Well, even though all of you here right now have presumably registered,

1075
00:53:02,869 --> 00:53:05,749
从技术上讲，没有什么可以阻止你们中的任何一个
technically there was nothing stopping any of you

1076
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:10,820
通过发短信，通过电子邮件或DM方式发送相同的URL
from texting or emailing or DMing this same URL

1077
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:12,290
互联网上的其他任何人。
to anyone else on the internet.

1078
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:14,789
因此，他们可能无需注册即可加入。
And they could therefore join, perhaps, without registering.

1079
00:53:14,789 --> 00:53:17,719
因此，也许这是一种威胁，但Zoom通常会向您发送
So maybe that's a threat, though, Zoom typically sends you

1080
00:53:17,719 --> 00:53:21,769
注册时不是这样简单的URL，而是更长的URL。
not a URL that's as simple as this when you register, but a longer one, indeed.

1081
00:53:21,769 --> 00:53:24,019
还有一些URL的详细信息，
And there's another detail that some URLs have,

1082
00:53:24,019 --> 00:53:25,879
也可能看起来像这样-
too, which might look like this--

1083
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:29,058
末尾有一个问号，密码为pwd，
a question mark at the end, and pwd for password,

1084
00:53:29,057 --> 00:53:30,349
然后输入某种密码。
and then some kind of password.

1085
00:53:30,349 --> 00:53:33,289
确实，您今天点击的网址看起来有点像这样，
And indeed, the URLs you clicked today looked a little more like that,

1086
00:53:33,289 --> 00:53:37,129
仍然有所不同，因为它们是特殊的注册URL。
still different because they were special registration URLs.

1087
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:40,670
但是在这里，如果您的URL拥有此密码，现在您
But here, if your URL has this password, now you

1088
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:43,280
需要同时知道会议ID和密码
need to know both the meeting ID and the password

1089
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,555
为了参加那个特定的Zoom会议。
in order to join that particular Zoom meeting.

1090
00:53:45,554 --> 00:53:48,679
如果您不参加大型课程，例如我们今天参加这次会议，
And if you're not running big classes, like we are today with this meeting,

1091
00:53:48,679 --> 00:53:51,979
而是您要举行一对一或更小规模的会议，
but rather you're having one-on-one or smaller scale meetings,

1092
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:56,480
通常，您正在接收或生成如下所示的URL，
typically you are receiving or generating a URL that looks like this,

1093
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,570
或更好的是，看起来像这样
or better yet, that looks like this, so that it

1094
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:02,660
对手仅仅猜测会议ID是不够的。
doesn't suffice for an adversary to just guess the meeting ID.

1095
00:54:02,659 --> 00:54:04,669
这就是早期发生的事情。
And that's what was happening early on.

1096
00:54:04,670 --> 00:54:07,520
缩放通常不需要人
Zoom typically did not require that people

1097
00:54:07,519 --> 00:54:10,819
选择他们的会议密码，这意味着你们之间唯一的事情
choose passwords for their meetings, which meant the only thing between you

1098
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:14,090
和一些对手Zoombomb轰炸您，可以说是骇客
and some adversary Zoombombing you, so to speak, hacking

1099
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:17,130
进入您的会议，他们只需要猜测会议ID。
into your meeting, which they just had to guess the meeting ID.

1100
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:19,580
我们已经看到花了我大约1分钟的时间
And we've seen already it took me, what, like 1 minute,

1101
00:54:19,579 --> 00:54:22,309
30秒写一个Python程序
30 seconds to write a Python program that

1102
00:54:22,309 --> 00:54:26,779
只是生成了所有可能的长度为4或8的数字。
just generated all possible numbers of length four or eight or whatever.

1103
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:29,570
所以有太多空闲时间的人正在写作
So people with too much free time are writing

1104
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:32,330
仅尝试所有可能的URL的代码。
code that just tries all possible URLs.

1105
00:54:32,329 --> 00:54:35,239
因此，如果您曾经被炸弹袭击，也许那是
And so if you've ever been Zoombombed, maybe that's

1106
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:38,119
因为某人与该不该共享的人共享了该URL。
because someone shared the URL with someone they shouldn't have.

1107
00:54:38,119 --> 00:54:42,139
或者也许有一定编程经验或只是运气好的人
Or maybe someone with a bit of programming experience or just luck

1108
00:54:42,139 --> 00:54:43,879
猜到了您的会议ID。
guessed your meeting ID.

1109
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:47,330
坦白说，从某种意义上说，这是一个功能
So this was a feature in the sense that, honestly,

1110
00:54:47,329 --> 00:54:50,269
不得不输入会议ID和密码只是很烦人。
having to type in a meeting ID and a password is just annoying.

1111
00:54:50,269 --> 00:54:52,829
它开始损害系统的可用性。
It starts to hurt the usability of the system.

1112
00:54:52,829 --> 00:54:55,069
在企业界，很多人
And a lot of people in the corporate world,

1113
00:54:55,070 --> 00:54:58,130
他们会选择另一种产品，如果另一种产品更容易
they're going to choose another product if another product is easier

1114
00:54:58,130 --> 00:54:59,870
开始视频会议。
to start the video conference with.

1115
00:54:59,869 --> 00:55:02,299
因此可以说，这是Zoom的有意识决定。
So arguably, it was a conscious decision on Zoom's part.

1116
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:04,092
现在大学和公司已经开始
Now universities and companies have started

1117
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:07,175
需要此功能或称为等候室的其他功能，其中一些人
requiring this or another feature called a waiting room, which some of you

1118
00:55:07,175 --> 00:55:08,510
可能今天经历过。
might have experienced today.

1119
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:12,680
但这又再次提高了攻击系统的门槛。
But that just, again, raises the bar to someone attacking the system.

1120
00:55:12,679 --> 00:55:14,209
那么Zoom安全吗？
So is Zoom secure?

1121
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:15,440
是的，没有。
Yes and no.

1122
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,660
确实应该考虑一下，
It really should be considered not in a vacuum,

1123
00:55:17,659 --> 00:55:21,109
但在担心哪种威胁的背景下
but in the context of what kinds of threats are you worried about

1124
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:25,400
您愿意采取什么样的防御措施？
and what kinds of defenses are you willing to put up?

1125
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:31,040
因此，就像在现实世界中一样，您可能拥有自己的房屋或公寓
So just like in the real world, you might have your own home or apartment

1126
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:36,839
或类似物品，窗户上可能有锁，螺栓和杆。
or the like, on which you might have locks and bolts and bars on the window.

1127
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,240
在某个时候，如果您需要五分钟才能解锁
At some point, if it takes you five minutes to unlock

1128
00:55:39,239 --> 00:55:41,939
门上的每把锁只是为了进入你的家，
every lock on your door just to get into your home,

1129
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:44,160
它可能更安全，但是您可能
it might be much more secure, but you're probably

1130
00:55:44,159 --> 00:55:47,279
不会享受回家的乐趣，因为它需要很长时间才能进入。
not going to enjoy going home because it takes that long to get in.

1131
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,310
您可能会在窗户上放一些横杆，以保持该人的身体安全，
And you might put bars on the window to keep that person physically out,

1132
00:55:50,309 --> 00:55:52,379
但看起来不会特别好。
but it's not going to look particularly nice.

1133
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:54,797
并没有阻止他们前进的脚步。
And there's nothing stopping them from going one floor up.

1134
00:55:54,797 --> 00:55:56,580
因此，也存在这种权衡。
So there, too, there's this trade-off.

1135
00:55:56,579 --> 00:55:59,129
因此，在外卖中，我们希望从今天起
And so among the takeaways, we hope, from today, are

1136
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:01,260
一，只是更好的思考过程
one, just better thought processes when it

1137
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:04,530
谈到您的手机或计算机意味着什么
comes to what does it mean for your phone or your computer

1138
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:06,573
或您的房屋，以确保安全，
or your homes for that matter to be secure,

1139
00:56:06,572 --> 00:56:09,239
并认识到总会有一些权衡。
and to recognize that there's always going to be some trade-off.

1140
00:56:09,239 --> 00:56:12,459
我们最终会鼓励您提出这类问题。
And we would encourage you, ultimately, to ask these kinds of questions.

1141
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:16,210
如果有任何公司，任何应用程序，任何网站只是在其网站上说，
If any company, if any app, if any website just says on their website,

1142
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:18,690
“我们很安全”，这是胡说八道。
"we are secure," that's nonsense.

1143
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:22,410
在您开始提出问题之前，这本身并没有任何意义，例如，
That means nothing in and of itself until you start asking questions, like,

1144
00:56:22,409 --> 00:56:25,889
您要保护什么？如何保护？
what are you secure against, and how?

1145
00:56:25,889 --> 00:56:27,759
好，非常感谢您在这里加入我们。
Well, thank you so much for joining us here.

1146
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:28,890
让我们正式包装在这里。
Let's officially wrap here.

1147
00:56:28,889 --> 00:56:32,249
但是我们欢迎人们多待一段时间
But folks are welcome to stick around for some more time

1148
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:34,720
如果您想在小组中提问。
if you'd like to ask questions in the group.

1149
00:56:34,719 --> 00:56:37,499
但是，如果您必须起飞，请随时出发。
But if you have to take off, please feel free to head out.

1150
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,649
