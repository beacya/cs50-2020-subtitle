2
00:00:48,432 --> 00:00:49,390
戴维·马兰：好的。
DAVID MALAN: All right.

3
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,050
这是CS50。
This is CS50.

4
00:00:51,049 --> 00:00:52,929
到此为止。
And this is the end.

5
00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:55,599
剩下的实际上就是您的最终项目。
All that remains here on out is really your final projects.

6
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,835
我们迫不及待想看到您创建的内容。
And we cannot wait to see what you create.

7
00:00:57,835 --> 00:01:00,460
今天，我们认为我们会做的是回顾一下，
Today what we thought we would do is take a bit of a look back,

8
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,400
但我们也很期待，以便您确切地知道
but also we'll look forward so that you know exactly where

9
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:06,549
以及CS50本身以外的其他功能。
and what you can do beyond CS50 itself.

10
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:08,649
但是首先要感谢。
But first a word of thanks.

11
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,200
我们当然在勒布戏剧中心
We are, of course, here in the Loeb Drama Center

12
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,380
与《美国话剧团》合作
with The American Repertory Theater, who have been our amazing hosts

13
00:01:14,379 --> 00:01:15,459
这整个学期。
this whole semester.

14
00:01:15,459 --> 00:01:20,259
的确，他们呼吸了新的生活，新的灯光，新的动画，新的声音
And truly, they have breathed new life, new lights, new animation, new sounds

15
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,100
进入CS50。
into CS50.

16
00:01:21,099 --> 00:01:23,349
我们非常感激能有这样的特权
And we are so grateful to have had such a privilege

17
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:27,039
与这里的才华横溢的团队合作，确实带来了
to work with the amazingly talented team here to indeed bring

18
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,460
整个生命阶段，并在整个学期中逐步发展。
this whole stage to life and evolve it over the course of the semester.

19
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:32,289
当然，还有CS50的团队。
And then, of course, there's CS50'S team.

20
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:34,360
虽然我是舞台上唯一的一个
And though I'm the only one here on stage

21
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:37,299
这个学期其他人分散得很远，
with everyone else spread quite far apart this semester,

22
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:42,219
没有CS50的团队，我们就拥有了我们拥有的视频，
it would not be without CS50's team that we have the videos that we have,

23
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:44,499
我们拥有的技术以及所有视觉效果
the technology that we have, and all of the visuals

24
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,169
希望补充一下您自己拥有的一切
that supplement, hopefully, everything that you yourselves

25
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,500
一直在动手。
have been doing hands on.

26
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:53,820
因此，非常感谢两个团队使本学期成为可能。
So thank you truly to both teams for having made this semester all possible.

27
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:57,189
可以说，在更加不寻常和困难的时期中，这些就足够了。
These are suffice it to say, among the more unusual and difficult times.

28
00:01:57,189 --> 00:02:00,519
我们希望，如果您现在正在观看直播，或者从现在开始的某个时间，
And we hope, if you're watching this now live, or in some time from now,

29
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:02,809
这样可以使每个人都身体健康。
that this finds everyone healthy and well.

30
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,050
的确，我们已经帮助您找到了自己的出路
And that, indeed, we have helped you find your way

31
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:08,538
沿着这条学习新事物的道路前进。
along this path of learning something new.

32
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:10,989
当然，还有更多的人
Of course, there's more folks even than that

33
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,160
在幕后，CS50的整个团队。
behind the scenes, CS50'S whole team.

34
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:15,429
当我看着这里的人群时，真的，那里
And when I look out on the crowd here, really, there

35
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,650
没有人在这里。
is no crowd here in person.

36
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,150
如果您想知道幕后的样子，
And if you've wondered what it looks like behind the scenes,

37
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,790
这张照片是什么的照片
pictured here is a photograph of exactly what

38
00:02:21,789 --> 00:02:24,399
我正在看到我们何时举行这些课程中的每一个。
it is I am seeing when we hold each of these classes.

39
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,100
确实，如果我们进行放大，那么当我们进行这些对话时
And indeed, if we Zoom in, when we're having these conversations

40
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:30,279
或回答或问问题，这真的只是我们
or answering or asking questions, it really is just us

41
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,960
和今年的一些电视屏幕。
and some TV screens here this year.

42
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,320
但是，我们确实希望不久以后能团聚。
But we do look forward to all reuniting before long.

43
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:37,939
现在幕后，确实有整个团队。
Now behind the scenes, there's indeed this whole team.

44
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:40,569
实际上，这里的图片只是其中的大部分，甚至没有
In fact, pictured here are just most of, but not even

45
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:44,439
所有，CS50的教学人员，助教和课程助手，
all, CS50'S teaching Fellows, teaching assistants, and course assistants,

46
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:48,519
无论是在哈佛还是在耶鲁，没有他们，这个学期也不会
both at Harvard and at Yale, without whom this semester would also not

47
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,028
可能的。
be possible.

48
00:02:49,027 --> 00:02:51,819
因为它们确实是支撑结构的支柱和支撑结构
Because they are, indeed, the backbone of and the support structure

49
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:53,889
让每个人最终完成
for getting everyone ultimately to the finish

50
00:02:53,889 --> 00:02:56,259
与问题集，实验室等保持一致。
line with problem sets, labs, and more.

51
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:59,739
但值得注意的是，我们所有人都容易犯错误。
But it's worth noting that we are all fallible.

52
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,050
而且，的确，我被告知这在什么时候具有启发性
And, indeed, I'm told it's fairly instructive when

53
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,950
我做错了什么，或者在舞台上有些困惑
I do something completely wrong, or get a little befuddled here on stage

54
00:03:05,949 --> 00:03:09,009
并且无法弄清楚为什么我自己的代码无法正常工作，
and can't quite figure out why my own code isn't working,

55
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:11,799
还是不能完全回答我的问题。
or can't quite answer a question off the top of my head.

56
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,862
这一切当然发生在我们所有人身上。
This all happens, certainly, to all of us.

57
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,819
因此，即使您在这里感觉到最后
So even if you are feeling here, toward the end

58
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:17,949
在学期中，并不是所有事物都被点击了
of the semester, that not everything quite clicked

59
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:20,829
而且有时您仍在努力在代码中找到该错误，
and you're still struggling sometimes to find that bug in your code,

60
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,860
还是您仍在搜寻或寻找一些较小的答案
or you're still googling or searching for some answer to some smaller

61
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:27,280
技术问题，请放心，或者在了解情况时感到放心，
technical problem, rest assured, or take comfort in knowing,

62
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,900
那永远不会消失。
that that is never really going to go away.

63
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,740
实际上，除了所有错误之外，还要加强这一点
And in fact, to reinforce that, besides all of the mistakes

64
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,250
我在这里做了舞台，我们以为我们会分享一些片段，
I here have made on stage, we thought we would share a little bit of a clip,

65
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,089
如果您愿意的话，从几周前教员准备时开始
some bloopers if you will, from when the teaching staff some weeks ago prepared

66
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:45,477
在视频上传递TCP / IP数据包的效果非常好，
that passing of TCP/IP packets on video, which worked out wonderfully well,

67
00:03:45,477 --> 00:03:47,560
人们在上，下，左，右走过的地方。
where folks were passing up, down, left and right.

68
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,290
目的是获得三个TCP / IP数据包
The goal of which was to get three TCP/IP packets

69
00:03:50,289 --> 00:03:52,209
从Zoom的右下角开始
from the bottom right-hand corner of Zoom

70
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,948
缩放的左上角。
to the top left-hand corner of Zoom.

71
00:03:53,948 --> 00:03:56,740
但是我们认为我们可以让您一窥到底发生了什么
But we thought we would give you a glimpse of what actually went on

72
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,990
在幕后，花了多少时间才带走了我们
behind the scenes and just how many takes it took us

73
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,970
甚至使演示正确。
to get even that demonstration right.

74
00:04:00,969 --> 00:04:03,699
我给您一些CS50的团队。
I give you some of CS50'S team.

75
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:04,599
[视频回放]
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

76
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:06,399
-我们去。
- There we go.

77
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,262
缓冲。
Buffering.

78
00:04:07,262 --> 00:04:08,620
好的。
OK.

79
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,818
乔希？
Josh?

80
00:04:09,818 --> 00:04:11,803
- 你好。
- Hi.

81
00:04:11,802 --> 00:04:14,049
-海伦，哦！
- Helen, oh!

82
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:17,858
[笑声]
[LAUGHTER]

83
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:18,899
-[听不清]。
- [INAUDIBLE].

84
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:19,839
不，等等
No, wait.

85
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:26,860
太好了，乔希。
That was amazing, Josh.

86
00:04:30,636 --> 00:04:34,164
嗯，索菲？
Um, Sophie?

87
00:04:34,163 --> 00:04:39,129
[笑声]
[LAUGHTER]

88
00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:41,639
惊人的。
Amazing.

89
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,489
那太完美了。
That was perfect.

90
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,532
莫妮
Moni?

91
00:04:44,531 --> 00:04:47,249
[笑声]
[LAUGHTER]

92
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,110
我想我 -
I think I--

93
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:52,220
-[听不清]。
- [INAUDIBLE].

94
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,338
- 惊人的。
- Amazing.

95
00:04:53,338 --> 00:04:53,838
-家伙？
- Guy?

96
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,050
那太精彩了。
That was amazing.

97
00:04:59,050 --> 00:04:59,775
谢谢你们。
Thank you all.

98
00:04:59,774 --> 00:05:00,809
- 超好的！
- So good!

99
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:01,676
[掌声]
[APPLAUSE]

100
00:05:01,675 --> 00:05:03,409
[结束播放]
[END PLAYBACK]

101
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:06,870
DAVID MALAN：可以这么说，计算机科学对我们所有人来说都很困难。
DAVID MALAN: So suffice it to say, computer science is hard for all of us.

102
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,510
因此，有些感觉，一些挫败感
And so some of these feelings, some of these frustrations

103
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:09,634
永远不会消失。
are never going to go away.

104
00:05:09,634 --> 00:05:12,536
但希望您确实拥有工具包中的所有其他工具，
But hopefully you have, indeed, all the more tools in your toolkit,

105
00:05:12,536 --> 00:05:14,369
现在更多的基础可以建立
all the more of a foundation now to build on

106
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:18,290
这样您就可以在向前迈进时感到不舒服
so that you can take comfort in being a little uncomfortable as you forge ahead

107
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,270
并解决新问题，学习新语言，
and solve new problems, learn new languages,

108
00:05:20,269 --> 00:05:22,489
并最终获得新的想法和技能。
and ultimately pick up new ideas and skills.

109
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,528
但是请记住，仅对于CS50，最终会发生什么
But remember, for CS50 alone, what ultimately

110
00:05:25,528 --> 00:05:27,320
在这门课程中重要的不是什么
matters in this course is not so much where

111
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:29,899
你最终会和你的同学有关，但是你最终会在哪里
you end up relative to your classmates, but where you end

112
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:32,359
开始时相对于您自己。
up relative to yourself when you began.

113
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,390
考虑一下，这不是很早以前就开始的。
And consider, it wasn't all that long ago that you began.

114
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:38,179
实际上，也许在几周前，
In fact, just some weeks ago was this perhaps,

115
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,640
您在CS50中遇到的最大问题，只是尝试
the biggest of your problems in CS50, just trying

116
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,949
弄清楚如何使金字塔正确对齐，
to figure out how to get the pyramid to align right,

117
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:44,779
不管您使用的是舒适度较低的版本还是更多
whether you did the less comfortable version or the more

118
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:47,389
舒适的版本，弄清楚如何打印空间，
comfortable version, figuring out how to print spaces,

119
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:50,749
如何将金字塔等移开，弄清楚如何嵌套循环，
how to shift the pyramid over and the like, figuring out how to nest loops,

120
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:54,140
更不用说正确处理所有分号和编译步骤了。
let alone getting all of the semicolons and compilation steps right.

121
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:56,689
然后，快进一两周前
And then, fast forward to just a week or two ago

122
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,599
当您构建自己的Web应用程序时，
when you built your very own web application, one

123
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,350
使用第三方API并提取了几乎实时的数据
that used a third party API and pulled in nearly real time data

124
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,800
并为用户生成视图，并有一个控制器来控制
and generated views for the user, had a controller governing

125
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,813
与模型完全一样，您正在读取和写入的所有数据
with the model exactly all of the data you were reading and writing

126
00:06:09,812 --> 00:06:10,354
等等。
and the like.

127
00:06:10,355 --> 00:06:15,432
就像，这是过去几个月的巨大方法。
Like, that is a huge way to have gone over the course of just a few months.

128
00:06:15,432 --> 00:06:16,640
因此，也要对此感到安慰。
So take comfort in that, too.

129
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,556
尤其是当您进入最终项目时
Especially as you dive into your final project

130
00:06:18,557 --> 00:06:21,680
可能还会撞到更多的墙
and might bump up against some more walls, those, too,

131
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,470
您最终会完成吗？
will you ultimately push through.

132
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:27,380
那么，在本学期的课程中，我们专注于什么？
So what have we focused on over the course of this semester?

133
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:30,549
很多时候我们都花时间谈论和进行编程。
A lot of the times we've spent time talking about and doing programming.

134
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,050
但实际上，我们想认为这是更高层次的
But really, we'd like to think it's some of the higher level

135
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,650
想法和外卖是最后的你
ideas and the takeaways that are what last you

136
00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:39,199
远远长于这些语言的细节。
far longer than the particulars of these languages.

137
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,679
无论是Scratch还是C，Python，JavaScript或SQL，
Whether it's Scratch or C or Python or JavaScript or SQL,

138
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,340
或我们研究过的任何其他实用工具，所有这些
or any of the other practical tools that we looked at, all of those

139
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:49,339
最终会以某种形式过时。
are eventually in some form going to be out of date.

140
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:52,159
否则他们可能会留在我们这里，是较老的语言
Or they might remain with us is older languages,

141
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,745
但是会出现更新更好的事情。
but newer and better things will come along.

142
00:06:54,745 --> 00:06:57,120
那么，我们希望在过去的几个月中，
And what we hope, then, is that over the past few months,

143
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,430
您已经摆脱了基础知识和诸如此类的基础
you've walked away with the fundamentals and sort of a foundation on which you

144
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:04,280
可以引导自己学习新事物，因为它们会不断涌现
can bootstrap yourself to learn new things as they come out

145
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:07,969
并真正将新事物减少到其基本组成部分，
and really reduce new things to their basic building blocks,

146
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:11,300
我们开始的拼图，您从中获得的第一原则
the puzzle pieces with which we began, first principles from which you

147
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,880
可以推断出一些新系统，新硬件的方式，
can infer how some new system, some new piece of hardware,

148
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:17,179
某种新语言必须如何工作。
how some new language must surely work.

149
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,360
因为在引擎盖下，到最后还是要这样，
Because underneath the hood, at the end of the day, it's still going to be,

150
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,160
在一段时间内，只有0和1。
for some time, just 0's and 1's.

151
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,510
因此，我们在第0周介绍了回忆，计算思维，
And so we introduced in Week 0, recall, computational thinking,

152
00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:29,989
鼓励您更系统，更算法地思考。
encouraging you to think more methodically, more algorithmically.

153
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:33,530
但是实际上，计算思维只是计算机科学家的化身
But really, computational thinking is just a computer scientist's incarnation

154
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:36,289
我们可能认为只是批判性思维的东西。
of what we might otherwise think of as just critical thinking.

155
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:39,290
该过程作为输入信息
This process is taking as input information

156
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,810
并产生一些解决方案。
and producing as output some solution.

157
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:45,050
在这两者之间，当然是我们的算法，
And in between there, of course, are our algorithms, the black box that's

158
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:48,360
做一些有趣的事情，也许很难。但是最终
doing something interesting and perhaps difficult. But at the end of the day,

159
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,370
这是解决问题的方法。
this is problem solving.

160
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:52,460
不管使用哪种语言，这都行不通
And this isn't going anywhere, irrespective of the languages

161
00:07:52,459 --> 00:07:56,279
您在使用过程中使用或拿起甚至忘记的地方。
that you use or pick up or even forget somewhere along the way.

162
00:07:56,279 --> 00:08:00,199
的确，今天，无论是输入还是输出都是二进制形式，
And indeed, today, too, whether this is input and output in binary form,

163
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:03,929
或仅仅是信息和决定或事实和结论，
or it's just information and decisions or facts and conclusions,

164
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:06,620
输入和生产的过程
this process of taking input and producing

165
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,500
作为输出正确答案，正确结论，
as output correct answers, correct conclusions,

166
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,259
正确的决定有望与您同在
correct decisions is hopefully going to be with you far

167
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:15,139
比C或Python的详细信息长
longer than the particulars of C or Python

168
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:19,549
或我们在本学期中花费了更多的动手技能。
or any of the more hands-on skills that we've spent time on this term.

169
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,530
还记得，至少在CS50中，
And recall, too, that at least within CS50,

170
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:27,499
我们建议您使用的工具评估方法的质量
the tools with which we propose that you evaluate the quality of your approach

171
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,740
解决问题的方法是这三个轴，第一个也是最重要的
to problem solving are these three axes, the first and foremost

172
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,090
其中肯定是正确的。
of which is surely correctness.

173
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:35,640
因为如果它不起作用，那么这首先意味着什么？
Because if it doesn't work, what's the point of it all in the first place?

174
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:39,678
因此，从输入到输出获取代码，算法和过程
So getting your code, your algorithm, your process from input to output

175
00:08:39,678 --> 00:08:41,899
正确无疑是最重要的。
to be correct is certainly paramount.

176
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:44,269
但是，随之而来的是设计问题。
But after that comes questions of design.

177
00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:46,729
如果您确实想构建更复杂的系统，
If you actually want to build more complex systems,

178
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,670
或解决更复杂的问题，您真的
or solve more sophisticated problems, you really

179
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:53,359
确实希望为这些问题设计干净的解决方案。
do want to design your solutions to those problems cleanly.

180
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,520
您不希望它们变慢或效率低下。
You don't want them to be slow or inefficient.

181
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,649
您不希望它们实际造成混乱。
You don't want them to be a mess in real terms.

182
00:08:57,649 --> 00:09:00,169
您不希望您的代码是完全无法理解的。
You don't want your code to be completely undecipherable.

183
00:09:00,169 --> 00:09:03,829
因为这只会妨碍您长期使用这些相同的工具，
Because that's just going to hamper you longer term to using those same tools,

184
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,970
那些相同的库来解决更有趣的事情，
those same libraries to solve more interesting,

185
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,340
更复杂的问题。
more sophisticated problems.

186
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,560
而且肯定会增加接口的难度
And it's surely going to make it harder to interface

187
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:12,659
与其他人，其他协作者和其他系统。
with other people, other collaborators, and other systems.

188
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:15,719
确实，按照这些思路，风格仍然重要吗？
And indeed along those lines, is style still important?

189
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,470
对于我们来说，这可能是三重奏中的第三次了。
It's perhaps the third in this trio for us.

190
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:22,160
但这是代码的美感，以及变量的缩进
But it's the aesthetics of your code, and the indentation in the variables

191
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:26,234
所有这些，就像您可能用我们的人类语言传达的那样，
and all that, much like you might convey in our human language,

192
00:09:26,235 --> 00:09:28,610
标点符号之类的东西使您的脚步向前。
put your best foot forward with punctuation and the like.

193
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,127
它只会帮助其他人了解您。
It just helps other people understand you.

194
00:09:31,126 --> 00:09:33,709
实际上，即使我们花费了大量时间进行互动
And indeed, even though we spent a lot of our time interacting

195
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:36,505
在一天的结束过程中，通过计算机进行类似的操作，
with computers, in a course like this, at the end of the day,

196
00:09:36,504 --> 00:09:37,879
你真的只是在交流。
you're really just communicating.

197
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:41,029
无论您是要与机器还是与其他人交流，
And whether you're communicating to a machine or to another human,

198
00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:44,119
干净利落地以有助于您的想法的方式进行操作，
doing that cleanly and in a way that helps your ideas,

199
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,380
您采用的解决方案肯定同样重要
your solutions, become adopted is surely no less important

200
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,709
比其他一些想法要好。
than some of these other ideas as well.

201
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,460
但是其他基本构件呢？
But what about other basic building blocks

202
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,610
超越了我们所做的特定语言和片段？
that transcend the particular languages and pieces that we did?

203
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:59,300
好吧，抽象，这个采用相当复杂的想法的想法
Well, abstraction, this idea of taking fairly complicated ideas

204
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:03,099
并简化它们，因此您不必担心较低的级别
and simplifying them so you don't have to worry about the lower level

205
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,400
实施细节，您只能专注于解决方案
implementation details, you can focus only on the solution

206
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,939
该拼图或该构建块实际提供的内容。
that that puzzle piece or that building block actually provides.

207
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,220
抽象无处不在。
And abstraction is everywhere around us.

208
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:15,850
当然，在代码中，我们将get_string之类的功能视为一种抽象。
Certainly in code, we saw functions like get_string as an abstraction.

209
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:16,690
我不知道。
I don't know.

210
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,790
我真的不记得确切的get_string
I don't really remember exactly how get_string

211
00:10:18,789 --> 00:10:21,219
在引擎盖下实现，更不用说功能了
is implemented underneath the hood, let alone a function

212
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,170
C附带的功能，例如printf。
that comes with C, like printf.

213
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:24,217
但我知道它有效。
But I know that it works.

214
00:10:24,217 --> 00:10:25,509
而且我知道这需要输入。
And I know that it takes input.

215
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:26,919
我知道它会产生输出。
I know that it produces output.

216
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:29,979
因此，我可以建立自己的想法，自己的软件，
And I can therefore build my own ideas, my own software,

217
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:34,090
在该构建块的顶部，抽象出这些细节。
on top of that building block, abstracting away those particulars.

218
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:37,570
在现实世界中，我们也将事物抽象化-
And in the real world, too, we abstract things--

219
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:42,070
我们始终采用复杂的想法或流程来抽象事物
we abstract away things all of the time, taking a complex idea or a process

220
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,870
并假设可以做到。
and assume that that will be done.

221
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,200
可能有人这样做。
Someone else might do that.

222
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,070
因此，我可以基于该过程的输出，
And I can therefore build on the output of that process,

223
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:51,700
即使我自己也不是基础实施方面的专家
even if I am myself am no expert in the underlying implementation

224
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,240
细节。
details thereof.

225
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,570
但是，还有一个精确度，另一个想法
But then there's precision, this other idea

226
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:58,030
非常重要的地方，当然在编写代码时，
where it's super important, certainly when writing code,

227
00:10:58,029 --> 00:11:02,139
而且当与另一个人交谈时，要精确并清楚地说明
but also when talking to another human, to be precise and make super clear

228
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:03,489
你是什么意思。
what you mean.

229
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:07,030
并考虑极端情况，考虑输入
And to consider the corner cases, to consider the inputs

230
00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:09,759
您可能不会期望的，但仍然可能
that you might not otherwise expect, but might nonetheless

231
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:13,809
发生，以便您不会犯错，并有一些意外的行为，因为我们
happen so that you don't err and have some unexpected behavior, as we

232
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:15,999
当然在实际代码中做过不止一次。
certainly did more than once in actual code.

233
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,100
有时，抽象和精度
And sometimes, abstractions and precisions

234
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,665
彼此有点矛盾。
are kind of at odds with one another.

235
00:11:19,664 --> 00:11:21,789
因为抽象会让您想一想
Because abstraction would sort of have you think at

236
00:11:21,789 --> 00:11:25,197
并在相当高的水平上交谈，而精确
and talk at a fairly high level, whereas precision

237
00:11:25,197 --> 00:11:27,489
会建议你真的应该进入杂草
would suggest that you really should get into the weeds

238
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:31,450
真的要一步一步地去给某人
and really go step by step by step when it comes to giving someone

239
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,490
其他或计算机指令。
else or a computer instructions.

240
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,010
而且我们认为我们可以将其变为现实，
And we thought we would bring this to life, perhaps,

241
00:11:36,009 --> 00:11:37,629
举几个例子。
with a couple of examples.

242
00:11:37,629 --> 00:11:40,629
我们认为我们会尽力让尽可能多的人参与进来，
And we thought we would try to involve as many people as we can in this,

243
00:11:40,629 --> 00:11:43,419
尽管很远，但如果可以的话，请所有人参加，
albeit from afar, by having everyone, if you can,

244
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:45,871
拿出一张纸和一支钢笔或一支铅笔。
take out a piece of paper and a pen or pencil.

245
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,829
如果您还没有足够的可用的话，也可以。
It's OK if you don't quite have that available.

246
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,955
如果您愿意，也可以在计算机上执行此操作
You can do this on a computer, too, if you'd rather

247
00:11:49,955 --> 00:11:53,390
在记事本或平板电脑上画画，或类似的东西都可以。
draw on a notepad or a tablet, or something like that totally fine.

248
00:11:53,389 --> 00:11:56,349
但理想情况下，现在取出要绘画的东西和一些东西
But ideally, taking out now something with which to draw and something

249
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,940
依靠。
to draw on.

250
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,700
我们将继续尝试并应用一些原则
We're going to go ahead and try to apply some principles

251
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,950
计算思维，看看有多有用或有多伤害
of computational thinking and see just how helpful or hurtful

252
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:09,680
它是在一个或另一个级别上使用抽象或精度。
it is to use abstraction or precision at one level or another.

253
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:12,249
所以我想做到这一点，布莱恩，我们将需要
So I think to do this, Brian, we're going to need

254
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,740
观众的帮助。
a helping hand from the audience.

255
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,650
我认为我们需要一个人
I think we're going to need for one person

256
00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:22,569
到外面去自愿写口头指示
out there to volunteer to write instructions verbally

257
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:23,593
给其他人。
for everyone else.

258
00:12:23,592 --> 00:12:25,509
我们将对待观众中的每个人，
We're going to treat everyone in the audience,

259
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:27,639
或实际上，听众中的n减去1个人
or really, n minus 1 people in the audience

260
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:30,339
就像今天将要编程的计算机一样。
as the computers today who are going to be programmed.

261
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,850
我们需要一名人类志愿者来当程序员。
And we need one human volunteer to be the programmer.

262
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:36,550
那位程序员将是Daniel。
And that programmer is going to be Daniel.

263
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:38,739
Daniel，谢谢您的自愿。
So Daniel, thank you for volunteering.

264
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:42,280
布赖恩，我们可以继续与丹尼尔分享，只有丹尼尔，
Brian, could we go ahead and share with Daniel, and only Daniel,

265
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:46,162
我们希望其他人画的东西的图片？
a picture of something that we want everyone else to draw?

266
00:12:46,163 --> 00:12:48,580
Daniel，您稍后应该在屏幕上看到的内容，
So Daniel, what you should see on your screen in a moment,

267
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,122
如果还没有的话，是一张照片。
if you haven't already, is a picture.

268
00:12:50,121 --> 00:12:51,879
不要告诉别人这是什么。
Don't tell anyone else what it is.

269
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:54,999
您可以随时使用任何单词。
You may use any words in a moment that you want.

270
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,653
请勿使用双手或类似手势。
You should not use your hands or any gestures like that.

271
00:12:57,653 --> 00:13:00,070
但是目标是口头写一个算法
But the goal is going to be to write an algorithm verbally

272
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,200
对于房间中的其他每个人，一步一步地，
for everyone else in the room, step by step,

273
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,530
因此理想情况下他们会画出您所看到的内容。
so that ideally they draw what it is you see.

274
00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:08,799
您可以说任何您想说的，但不能说任何肢体动作。
And you can say anything you want, but just no physical gestures.

275
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:10,419
那有意义吗？
Does that make sense?

276
00:13:10,419 --> 00:13:10,959
- 知道了。
- Got it.

277
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,043
你想谈谈你自己吗
And do you want to say a little bit about yourself

278
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:14,727
在开始之前先进入小组？
first to the group before we begin?

279
00:13:14,726 --> 00:13:15,309
学生：好的。
STUDENT: Sure.

280
00:13:15,309 --> 00:13:16,149
我叫丹尼尔。
My name's Daniel.

281
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:20,589
我来自耶鲁大学Ezra Stiles College。
I'm from Ezra Stiles College at Yale University.

282
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,915
这个学期我真的是CS50。
And I really CS50 this semester.

283
00:13:22,914 --> 00:13:24,039
大卫·马兰：哦，太好了。
DAVID MALAN: Oh, wonderful.

284
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:25,599
感谢您的志愿服务。
Thank you for volunteering.

285
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,290
让我们继续前进，让其他人拥有他们的论文
And let's go ahead and have everyone else with their paper

286
00:13:29,289 --> 00:13:30,639
和铅笔或钢笔准备好了。
and pencil or pen ready.

287
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,649
丹尼尔（Daniel），每个人要做的第一件事就是第一步。
Daniel, what should be the first thing everyone does, step one.

288
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:34,149
学生：好的。
STUDENT: OK.

289
00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:38,679
因此，我们要绘制的第一件事是六角形。
So the first thing we're going to draw is a hexagon.

290
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:40,779
因此，它是规则的六边形。
So it's a regular hexagon.

291
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:50,827
并且我们将确保绘制它，以便其中一个顶点
And we're going to make sure that we draw it so that one of the vertices

292
00:13:50,827 --> 00:13:53,369
在六边形的最底部，并且其中一个顶点
is on the very bottom of the hexagon, and one of the vertices

293
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,990
在六边形的顶部。
is at the very top of the hexagon.

294
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:58,210
因此，一侧没有平放。
So one side is not laying flat.

295
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:58,958
你正在做的 -
You're doing--

296
00:13:58,957 --> 00:14:00,249
大卫·马兰：哇，该死，该死。
DAVID MALAN: Wup, dut, dut dut.

297
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,119
没有手势。
No hand gestures.

298
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,287
学生：没有手，没有手。
STUDENT: No hands, no hands.

299
00:14:02,287 --> 00:14:03,400
正确的。
Right.

300
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:06,939
一个顶点在最顶部，一个顶点在最底部。
One vertice at the very top, one vertice is at the very bottom.

301
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,850
而且您的侧面还有其他四个顶点。
And you've got your other four vertices on the sides.

302
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,870
所以一旦有了六角形，下一步
So once you've got your hexagon, your next step

303
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:18,580
将会找到您的六边形的中点。
is going to be find your midpoint of the hexagon.

304
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,740
因此，一旦找到中点，您就可以
And so once you've found your midpoint, you're

305
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:26,080
从顶点到该中点画三条线。
going to draw three lines from a vertices to that midpoint.

306
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,440
您要选择绘制的顶点
The vertices that you're going to choose to draw from

307
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:37,510
从最底端到中点，然后从中点到顶点
are the very bottom to the midpoint and then from the midpoint to the vertices

308
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:42,141
在顶部顶点的左侧和右侧。
that are on the left and right of the top vertices.

309
00:14:42,142 --> 00:14:43,100
戴维·马兰：好的。
DAVID MALAN: All right.

310
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,720
还有任何最终指示吗？
Any final instructions?

311
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,858
学生：我认为，应该是这样。
STUDENT: I think, hopefully, that should be it.

312
00:14:48,857 --> 00:14:49,899
大卫·马兰：[音频不清晰]。
DAVID MALAN: [INAUDIBLE].

313
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:51,669
这些是很长的第一步和第二步。
Those were very long steps one and two.

314
00:14:51,669 --> 00:14:53,229
但是，是的。
But yes.

315
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,690
好吧，让我们继续揭示一下。
All right, well, let's go ahead and reveal.

316
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:57,310
这将是一点点黑客。
This will be a little bit of a hack.

317
00:14:57,309 --> 00:14:59,889
但是，如果有人，每个人都乐于接受
But if anyone everyone is comfortable picking up

318
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:02,309
他们的纸或平板电脑，并握住它
their piece of paper or their tablet and holding it

319
00:15:02,309 --> 00:15:07,979
在他们的Zoom相机前稳稳地摆放5或10秒，
in front of their Zoom camera steadily for five or 10 seconds,

320
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,100
我们将确切地看到每个人都画了什么。
we'll see exactly what everyone has drawn.

321
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,950
如果进入图库视图，您将可以看到其他所有人。
If you go into gallery view, you'll be able to see everyone else.

322
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:17,220
丹尼尔，希望您能看到一些熟悉的图片？
Daniel, hopefully you're seeing some familiar pictures?

323
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,940
我认为我们一定有范围。
I think we definitely have range.

324
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,547
您是否看到一个或多个与您的想法相符的东西？
Are you seeing one or more that match what you had in mind?

325
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:23,130
学生：是的。
STUDENT: Yeah.

326
00:15:23,129 --> 00:15:24,209
它们看起来都不错。
They all look pretty good.

327
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:24,900
戴维·马兰：所有人？
DAVID MALAN: They all?

328
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:25,899
好吧，很好。
All right, so good.

329
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:28,019
那么，让我继续，然后在屏幕上分享
Let me go ahead, then, and share on my screen

330
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:31,189
丹尼尔刚才描述了什么。
in just a moment what it is Daniel was describing.

331
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,260
因此，布莱恩事先与丹尼尔分享的是这张照片
So what Brian had shared with Daniel in advance was this picture

332
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:38,489
在这里，我敢说是一个立方体。
here, which I dare say is a cube.

333
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:42,360
但实际上，它是由一个六边形然后是附加的线组成的
But indeed, it's composed of a hexagon and then the additional lines

334
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,410
丹尼尔描述的。
that Daniel described.

335
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:47,669
丹尼尔（Daniel），我确实碰巧看到了，也许是在《缩放》的第二页和第三页上
And Daniel, I did happen to see, maybe on pages two and three of the Zoom

336
00:15:47,669 --> 00:15:52,589
窗口中，肯定有一些不完全是立方体。
window, there were definitely some that weren't quite cubes.

337
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:57,330
您如何对待自己的想法
What was going through your mind as to how you approached

338
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,420
您提供的算法？
the algorithm that you provided?

339
00:15:59,419 --> 00:16:02,249
学生：我想-
STUDENT: I wanted to--

340
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,040
对我来说，穿过我的头的第一件事是一个立方体。
to me, the first thing that went through my head was a cube.

341
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:08,039
但是我知道有很多方法可以绘制一个立方体。
But I knew that there's so many ways to draw a cube.

342
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:09,979
我不想将其描述为一个多维数据集。
I didn't want to describe it as a cube.

343
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,730
因为如果我说只是画一个立方体，我知道
Because if I said just draw a cube, I knew

344
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,990
我们会得到很多不同的结果。
that we would get tons of different results.

345
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:16,260
所以我想尽可能清楚。
So I wanted to be as clear as possible.

346
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:21,029
我知道，如果我可以用某种数学方式来描述它，
And I knew that if I could describe it in sort of a mathematical way,

347
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:23,504
用六角形描述它并描述它
describing it with a hexagon and describing it

348
00:16:23,504 --> 00:16:27,689
顶点在中点，希望会有更多的人
with the vertices in the midpoint, that hopefully more people would

349
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,790
能够绘制精确的形状。
be able to draw a precise shape.

350
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:30,539
戴维·马兰：是的。
DAVID MALAN: Yeah.

351
00:16:30,539 --> 00:16:31,349
说的真好。
Really well said.

352
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,420
现在，如果我们每个人的音量都很大，那么奇怪的是，
Now if we had everyone's volume on, odd are,

353
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:35,519
您现在可能会听到一些咯咯的笑声，
you'd hear a bit of chuckling now, perhaps,

354
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,382
或有点尴尬。
or maybe a little bit of awkwardness.

355
00:16:37,383 --> 00:16:40,050
我敢说并不是所有的照片都是那样的，
And I daresay not all of the pictures quite turned out that way,

356
00:16:40,049 --> 00:16:43,109
但这是一个完美的例子，说明抽象也许可以帮助我们
but that's a perfect example of where maybe abstractions can kind of get us

357
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:43,652
陷入麻烦。
into trouble.

358
00:16:43,652 --> 00:16:47,190
因为如果丹尼尔刚才说的，画一个立方体，对，你们中的一些人
Because if Daniel had just said, draw a cube, right, some of you

359
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,833
可能会立即开始绘制一个立方体。
might start drawing immediately a cube.

360
00:16:48,832 --> 00:16:51,999
但是你们中的许多人都会有一个问题，那么方向应该是什么？
But many of you would have a question, well, what should the orientation be?

361
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,900
大小应该是多少？
What should the size be?

362
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:53,819
职位应该是什么？
What should the position be?

363
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,350
因此，精确度变得越来越重要。
And so there, precision becomes increasingly important.

364
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,562
但越精确，你们中的几率就越大
But the more precise it gets, odds are some of you

365
00:16:58,562 --> 00:17:01,770
只是数量的细节和某种迷失的方向不知所措
just kind of got overwhelmed with the amount of detail and sort of lost track

366
00:17:01,769 --> 00:17:04,439
你的笔或铅笔应该在某一点
where your pen or pencil was supposed to be at one point

367
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,190
因为您的工作水平要低得多。
because you were operating at a much lower level.

368
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,910
那么，就有这种紧张感了。
So there's this tension, then.

369
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:11,410
但是我认为我们确实使你们中的一些人达到了终点线。
But I think we did get some of you to that finish line.

370
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,530
让我们看看我们现在是否无法减轻所有人的压力，
Let's see if we can't now take the pressure off of all of you,

371
00:17:13,529 --> 00:17:15,404
并特别感谢Daniel，让我们
and thank you to Daniel, in particular, let's

372
00:17:15,404 --> 00:17:19,034
看看我们现在是否不能让你们所有人一起编程给我，如果可以的话。
see if we can't now have all of you collectively program me, if you will.

373
00:17:19,035 --> 00:17:21,160
所以我要继续在这里拉起我的屏幕
So I'm going to go ahead and pull up my screen here

374
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,900
在这里，我可以在屏幕上用鼠标和光标进行绘制。
where I have the ability to draw with my mouse and cursor on my screen here.

375
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:29,190
而Brian，如果您不介意，可以与所有人分享
And Brian, if you don't mind, could you share with everyone

376
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:34,560
否则，我保证我不会提前看过的照片。
else a picture that I promise I have not seen in advance.

377
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:35,889
因此，我们将看到情况如何。
So we will see how this goes.

378
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:38,280
所以我是Zoom室中唯一的一个
So I'm the only one right now in the Zoom room

379
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:39,989
尚未看到这张照片。
that has not seen this picture.

380
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,930
但是Brian离开了，只向所有人提供了URL。
But Brian has gone and provided only you all with the URL.

381
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,640
因此，将其拉到屏幕上。
So pull that up on your screen.

382
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,760
然后，布莱恩，如果我们可以反复呼吁一些志愿者的话。
And then, Brian, if we could perhaps iteratively call on some volunteers.

383
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:52,476
我为什么不尝试一步一步地画出别人告诉我的事情？
Why don't I try to draw what people tell me to do, step by step?

384
00:17:52,477 --> 00:17:53,310
布莱恩·于：好的。
BRIAN YU: All right.

385
00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:54,329
大卫没有看到这一点。
David has not seen this.

386
00:17:54,329 --> 00:17:56,759
我只是在五分钟前选择了这个。
I just picked this out, like, five minutes ago.

387
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:59,676
如果你想给他举手，所有人都会举手，例如，
And you're all going to raise your hand if you want to give him, like,

388
00:17:59,676 --> 00:18:01,559
下一步操作的一条指令。
one instruction for what to do next.

389
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:03,779
让我们从乔治开始。
And let's start with George.

390
00:18:03,779 --> 00:18:06,569
学生：所以您将从绘画开始
STUDENT: So you're going to start by drawing

391
00:18:06,569 --> 00:18:09,592
屏幕顶部附近的圆圈。
a circle near the top of the screen.

392
00:18:09,593 --> 00:18:10,260
戴维·马兰：好的。
DAVID MALAN: OK.

393
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:11,969
屏幕顶部附近的圆圈。
A circle near the top of the screen.

394
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:15,100
让我说清楚，我在计算机上没有删除功能。
And let me make clear, I have no delete abilities on the computer.

395
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:16,649
所以一旦我提交，我们就进入了。
So once I commit, we're in.

396
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:20,940
因此，在屏幕顶部附近画一个圆。
So drawing a circle near the top of the screen.

397
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,720
好的。
OK.

398
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,710
谢谢你，乔治。
Thank you, George.

399
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:23,820
Brian，第二步？
Brian, step two?

400
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:25,749
布莱恩·于：好，接下来我们去索菲亚。
BRIAN YU: All right, let's go to Sophia next.

401
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:32,799
学生：然后，在屏幕的正中央，用黑色圆圈填充门，
STUDENT: Then, in the very center of the screen, door a black, filled in circle,

402
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,232
这大约是顶部圆圈的十分之一。
which is approximately a tenth of the size of the circle at the top.

403
00:18:36,232 --> 00:18:36,899
戴维·马兰：好的。
DAVID MALAN: OK.

404
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:41,710
我听说一个黑色的实心圆圈是大小的十分之一。
A black, filled in circle, I heard, that's a tenth of the size.

405
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:46,580
因此，我将要做类似的事情，然后将其阴影化。
So I'm going to do something like this, and then just kind of shade it in.

406
00:18:46,579 --> 00:18:48,109
好的，谢谢索菲亚。
All right, thank you, Sophia.

407
00:18:48,109 --> 00:18:48,799
第三步？
Step three?

408
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,269
布莱恩·于：我们去圣地亚哥。
BRIAN YU: Let's go to Santiago.

409
00:18:50,269 --> 00:18:55,289
学生：您将再画一个圆。
STUDENT: You're going to draw another circle.

410
00:18:55,289 --> 00:18:57,439
但这实际上不是一个圆圈，
But it's not actually going to be a circle,

411
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:04,190
它更像是一个椭圆，它将比第一个更大。
it's more of an ellipse, that's going to be bigger than the first one.

412
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,610
所以它将在中间。
So it's going to be in the middle.

413
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:08,359
并将其围成一个圆圈
And it's going to enclose that filled in circle

414
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:10,722
并在底部留一些空间。
and leave some room in the bottom.

415
00:19:10,722 --> 00:19:11,389
戴维·马兰：好的。
DAVID MALAN: OK.

416
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,182
所以这是一个椭圆形。
So it's an ellipse.

417
00:19:12,182 --> 00:19:14,670
它比第一个圆圈大。
It's bigger than the first circle.

418
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:18,320
但是它包围着较小的那个吗？
But it encloses the smaller one?

419
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:20,104
好吧，所以我听到了这样的话。
All right, so I heard kind of this.

420
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:26,259
好的。
OK.

421
00:19:26,259 --> 00:19:27,909
第4步？
Step 4?

422
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:30,280
学生：在那个较小的椭圆下，
STUDENT: Under that smaller ellipse, you're

423
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:35,109
想要在其下画一个更大的圆圈
going to want to draw a bigger circle underneath it

424
00:19:35,109 --> 00:19:38,019
并表现得好像圆正穿过那个椭圆，
and act as if the circle is going through that ellipse,

425
00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:41,319
但实际上不显示穿过椭圆的线。
but don't actually show the lines going through the ellipse.

426
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:44,589
也就是说，我们在下面画了一个更大的圆圈，但没有
So that is, we draw a bigger circle underneath, but without having

427
00:19:44,589 --> 00:19:46,239
线通过。
the lines go through.

428
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,250
看起来它似乎正在经历其边缘。
It looks like it will kind of be going through the edge of it.

429
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,270
戴维·马兰：好的。
DAVID MALAN: OK.

430
00:19:51,269 --> 00:20:01,849
我在这里有点担心，但是我听到的是这样的，也许是吗？
I'm a little worried here, but what I heard was like this, maybe?

431
00:20:01,849 --> 00:20:03,619
第五步？
Step five?

432
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:07,189
布莱恩·于（Brian Yu）：好的，接下来我们转到[音频不清晰]。
BRIAN YU: All right, let's go to [INAUDIBLE] next.

433
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:11,060
学生：所以在这种中椭圆形中，
STUDENT: So in that kind of middle ellipse,

434
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:14,001
你知道，例如当孩子表现得像飞机一样时，
you know, like, when kids act like they're an airplane,

435
00:20:14,001 --> 00:20:15,709
然后他们发出飞机噪音，
and then they make, like, airplane noise,

436
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,627
然后他们用胳膊做那奇怪的事情？
then they do that weird thing with their arms?

437
00:20:17,626 --> 00:20:18,829
大卫·马兰（David MALAN）：恩。
DAVID MALAN: Uh huh.

438
00:20:18,829 --> 00:20:21,889
学生：所以在那中间的椭圆形上画些像手臂一样的东西，
STUDENT: So draw those kind of, like, arms in that middle ellipse,

439
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,152
从大椭圆形出来。
coming out of the big middle ellipse.

440
00:20:24,152 --> 00:20:25,610
戴维·马兰（DAVID MALAN）：在椭圆的中间吗？
DAVID MALAN: In the middle ellipse?

441
00:20:25,609 --> 00:20:28,009
这个低一点？
This lower one?

442
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:29,959
学生：外面的那个。
STUDENT: The one outside of it.

443
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,720
大卫·马兰（David MALAN）：哦，这个大椭圆形？
DAVID MALAN: Oh, this big ellipse?

444
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,050
学生：是的，外在的界限。
STUDENT: Yeah, the outer bound.

445
00:20:34,049 --> 00:20:34,549
是的。
Yeah.

446
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:37,882
戴维·马兰（David MALAN）：好的，所以我应该像小孩子一样举起手来-
DAVID MALAN: All right, so I should draw some hands like a kid would have when--

447
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,570
好的。
OK.

448
00:20:43,569 --> 00:20:45,526
我不确定这会顺利结束。
I'm not sure this is going to end well.

449
00:20:45,527 --> 00:20:46,360
布莱恩·于：好的。
BRIAN YU: All right.

450
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:49,179
我们需要更多的志愿者来帮助David完成这项工作。
We need some more volunteers to help David finish this.

451
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,420
让我们去加布里埃尔。
Let's go to Gabrielle.

452
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,590
学生：好的。
STUDENT: OK.

453
00:20:52,589 --> 00:20:55,146
尝试画一个-
Try to draw a--

454
00:20:55,146 --> 00:20:56,771
大卫·马兰（DAVID MALAN）：尝试是有效的词。
DAVID MALAN: Try is the operative word.

455
00:20:56,771 --> 00:20:58,499
[笑声]
[LAUGHTER]

456
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,344
学生：您有一个更大的椭圆
STUDENT: You've got a bigger ellipse that's

457
00:21:00,345 --> 00:21:04,110
在最底部，它比顶部和中部都大，
at the very bottom, that's bigger than both the top and middle one,

458
00:21:04,109 --> 00:21:07,619
但中间的那条和那一条之间没有重叠的线
but showing no overlapping lines between the middle one and the one

459
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:08,579
您正在尝试。
that you're trying.

460
00:21:08,579 --> 00:21:10,439
戴维·马兰（DAVID MALAN）：所以不要显示重叠的线。
DAVID MALAN: So show no overlapping lines.

461
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,460
因此，我听到了更大的椭圆。
So I heard an even bigger ellipse.

462
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,640
因此，抱歉，对不起。
So, like, oops, sorry.

463
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,540
这？
This?

464
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:16,709
好的？
OK?

465
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:17,550
学生：干得好。
STUDENT: Good job.

466
00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:18,149
戴维·马兰：谢谢。
DAVID MALAN: Thank you.

467
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:18,570
好的。
OK.

468
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:18,869
好的。
Good.

469
00:21:18,869 --> 00:21:20,609
保持积极的援军到来。
Keep the positive reinforcement coming.

470
00:21:20,609 --> 00:21:21,861
最后几步？
Final couple steps?

471
00:21:21,862 --> 00:21:22,695
布莱恩·于：好的。
BRIAN YU: All right.

472
00:21:22,694 --> 00:21:23,636
[？伊卡？]
[? Ika? ?]

473
00:21:23,636 --> 00:21:25,469
学生：您还必须执行另一步骤
STUDENT: One other step you would have to do

474
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:30,840
画一个小圆圈，比那个小
is draw a small, filled in circle, slightly smaller than the one

475
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:34,229
你已经画过了，就在第一个圆的中心
you already drew, right in the center of the first circle

476
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,883
你在顶部画了。
you drew right at the top.

477
00:21:35,883 --> 00:21:36,550
戴维·马兰：好的。
DAVID MALAN: OK.

478
00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:38,216
就在第一个圆的中心。
Right in the center of the first circle.

479
00:21:38,217 --> 00:21:38,820
好的。
OK.

480
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:41,159
我认为这对我来说已经初具规模。
And I think this is starting to take shape for me.

481
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,013
我为我之前的一些决定感到遗憾。
And I regret some of my earlier decisions.

482
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:46,929
布莱恩·于：[音频不清晰]，您想提供额外的说明吗？
BRIAN YU: [INAUDIBLE],, you want to provide an additional instruction?

483
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,472
学生：您刚刚绘制的最后一个圆圈之间的另一个圆圈
STUDENT: Another circle in between the last one you just drew

484
00:21:49,471 --> 00:21:53,519
在圆的边缘之间，所以
and in between the edge of the circle, so

485
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:56,489
在该圆的左侧，您将绘制另一个圆。
to the left of that circle you're going to draw another circle.

486
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:59,550
戴维·马兰（DAVID MALAN）：在这个圆圈的左边？
DAVID MALAN: To the left of this circle?

487
00:21:59,549 --> 00:22:00,389
学生：嗯。
STUDENT: Mhm.

488
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,057
戴维·马兰：好的。
DAVID MALAN: OK.

489
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,150
布莱恩·于：还有瑞安？
BRIAN YU: And Ryan?

490
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:08,730
学生：在下面，您将要重复相同的过程，
STUDENT: Underneath, you're going to want to repeat the same process,

491
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:10,850
除了在右侧画一个圆。
except draw a circle on the right side.

492
00:22:10,849 --> 00:22:12,279
戴维·马兰：好的。
DAVID MALAN: OK.

493
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:13,257
小循环。
Little loop.

494
00:22:13,258 --> 00:22:15,800
布莱恩·于：我想我们可能还要再走一两个步骤。
BRIAN YU: I think we've got maybe one or two more steps left.

495
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:17,199
让我们回到索菲亚。
Let's go back to Sophia.

496
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,130
学生：在实心圆圈下方，即椭圆的中间，
STUDENT: Underneath the filled in circle, that's in the middle ellipse,

497
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:25,360
您想绘制该圆的两个副本
you want to draw two replicas of that circle

498
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:28,629
在原始椭圆的下方。
below the original one in the middle ellipse.

499
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:33,310
戴维·马兰（DAVID MALAN）：在椭圆的中间，所以在这里。
DAVID MALAN: In the middle ellipse, so here, OK.

500
00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:35,529
我想我知道这是什么。
I think I know what this is.

501
00:22:35,529 --> 00:22:37,869
布莱恩·于：杰森，最后一条指令怎么样？
BRIAN YU: And Jason, how about one last instruction?

502
00:22:37,869 --> 00:22:39,609
戴维·马兰：好的。
DAVID MALAN: All right.

503
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:42,099
学生：在最上方的圆圈下方，
STUDENT: Underneath, in the top most circle,

504
00:22:42,099 --> 00:22:46,839
在三下，因此排成三个圆圈，画一个宽V，
under the three, so the row of three circles, draw a wide V,

505
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:48,849
有两条直线的形状。
sort of shaped with two straight lines.

506
00:22:48,849 --> 00:22:51,999
DAVID MALAN：宽V带两条直线。
DAVID MALAN: A wide V with two straight lines.

507
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,750
好的。
OK.

508
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,930
我认为那部分我被钉住了。
That part, I think, I nailed.

509
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:57,640
我可以切换显示吗？
Shall I switch over and reveal?

510
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,130
因此，这是我相信所有人都给的URL。
So this is the URL I believe all of you were given.

511
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,510
我还没去过
I have not visited it yet.

512
00:23:01,509 --> 00:23:04,779
但是，如果我现在去参观。
But if I go and visit this now.

513
00:23:04,779 --> 00:23:06,909
嘿，那还不算太糟。
Hey, that's not all that bad.

514
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:09,245
好吧，我绝对是绕道而行。
All right, I definitely took a detour partway through.

515
00:23:09,244 --> 00:23:10,369
但这是另一个例子。
But here's another example.

516
00:23:10,369 --> 00:23:13,839
您是否刚开始按如下方式绘制雪人，例如，
Had you just started with draw a snowman as follows, like,

517
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:16,599
确实可以帮助我使自己的精神定位相似
that might have helped orient me, truthfully, similar in spirit

518
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:20,196
但以丹尼尔（Daniel）的设计为例，它将为您提供有关我的思想模型
to Daniel's design that would have given you a mental model of what I,

519
00:23:20,196 --> 00:23:23,029
或给我一个我应该一直在画的心智模型。
or given me a mental model of what it is I should have been drawing.

520
00:23:23,029 --> 00:23:25,089
因此，在这里，抽象也很难。
So here, too, abstraction is hard.

521
00:23:25,089 --> 00:23:28,839
甚至精度也很难确定正确的细节水平
And even precision is hard and figuring out the right level of detail

522
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:32,229
操作是解决问题过程的一部分。
to operate at is kind of part of the process of problem solving.

523
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:34,780
不过，现在看来，这还算不错。
Though, now that I look at it, that's actually not half bad.

524
00:23:34,779 --> 00:23:36,821
就像，我肯定在这里做错了。
Like, I definitely did the wrong thing over here.

525
00:23:36,821 --> 00:23:40,389
但是对我们所有的在线志愿者都做得很好。
But very well done to all of our volunteers online.

526
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:43,060
因此，当您
So remember these kinds of details when you're

527
00:23:43,059 --> 00:23:46,177
当你给某人某事时，试图向某人解释一些过程
trying to explain some process to someone, when you're giving someone

528
00:23:46,178 --> 00:23:48,970
说明，即使是在现实世界中，
instructions, even if it's for something mundane in the real world,

529
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:53,470
就像去办事或在市场上取货一样，要精确
like going to run errands or pick up supplies at the market, being precise

530
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:56,830
当然很重要，但是您提供的精度越高，就越容易
is certainly important, but the more precision you provide, the much easier

531
00:23:56,829 --> 00:23:59,869
这是一个人迷失在那些杂草中。
it is for the person to get lost in those weeds.

532
00:23:59,869 --> 00:24:05,029
因此，有时某个人可能需要的只是更高级别的详细信息列表。
And so sometimes a higher level list of details is all that someone might need.

533
00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:07,946
因此，您现在具备了编程和做事的能力
So now that you have this ability to program and to do things

534
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,029
我们已经在讲座和习题集中向您展示了
that we've shown you in lectures and problem sets,

535
00:24:10,029 --> 00:24:11,799
确实有能力找出
and indeed, have the ability to figure out

536
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:13,869
如何做我们甚至还没有向您展示的事情，
how to do things that we haven't even shown you,

537
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:17,349
我们想花点时间考虑一下您是否应该做这些事情
we wanted to take a moment to consider just whether you should do those things

538
00:24:17,349 --> 00:24:19,219
以及，如果应该的话，应该如何做。
and, if you should, how you should do them.

539
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,970
但是，您不仅可以凭自己的直觉回答这些问题，
But beyond just answering these questions with your own instincts,

540
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,012
我们认为我们会邀请一些同事
we thought we would invite some of our colleagues

541
00:24:24,011 --> 00:24:27,279
由哲学系提出一个更正式的框架，
from the Philosophy department to propose a more formal framework,

542
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,739
一个思考过程，通过它我们可以解决问题
a thought process by which we can approach problems

543
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,050
在技术和代码编写方面
when it comes to technology and the writing of code

544
00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:36,079
最终只是因为我可以编写一些东西来帮助我们做出决定，
to help us decide, ultimately, just because I can code something,

545
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:39,819
我应该，如果确实如此，我应该怎么做？
should I, and if so, indeed, how should I do that?

546
00:24:39,819 --> 00:24:43,089
因此，请允许我介绍一下Meica哲学系的同事
So allow me to introduce our colleagues from the Philosophy department, Meica

547
00:24:43,089 --> 00:24:45,609
Magnani和Susan Kennedy。
Magnani and also Susan Kennedy.

548
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:46,599
梅卡（Meica）？
Meica?

549
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:47,589
MEICA MAGNANI：嗨。
MEICA MAGNANI: So hi.

550
00:24:47,589 --> 00:24:48,999
我是Meica Magnani。
I'm Meica Magnani.

551
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,689
我是嵌入式道德计划的哲学博士后
I am a philosophy postdoc with the Embedded Ethics Program

552
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:53,380
在哈佛。
here at Harvard.

553
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,130
苏珊·肯尼迪：你好。
SUSAN KENNEDY: Hi.

554
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:54,910
我是Susan Kennedy。
I'm Susan Kennedy.

555
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:59,020
我还是哈佛大学嵌入式道德计划的哲学博士后。
And I'm also a philosophy postdoc with the Embedded Ethics Program at Harvard.

556
00:24:59,019 --> 00:25:01,039
MEICA MAGNANI：在我们开始之前，
MEICA MAGNANI: And before we get started,

557
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,859
我只想谈谈嵌入式道德计划。
I'll just say a few things about the Embedded Ethics Program.

558
00:25:03,859 --> 00:25:08,379
所以我们是哲学家和计算机的跨学科团队
So we are an interdisciplinary team of philosophers and computer

559
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:12,250
科学家们共同努力，将伦理学纳入计算机科学
scientists working together to integrate ethics into the computer science

560
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,570
课程。
curriculum.

561
00:25:13,569 --> 00:25:17,919
这种方法背后的想法是嵌入道德推理工具
The idea behind this approach is to embed tools of ethical reasoning

562
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:21,040
自己进入计算机科学课程。
into computer science courses themselves.

563
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:25,539
这样做的原因是，在对设计，部署进行决策时，
The reason for this is that when making decisions about the design, deployment,

564
00:25:25,539 --> 00:25:30,129
或一项技术的发展，无论是否意识到，
or development of a piece of technology, one is, whether or not one realizes it,

565
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,990
做出符合道德的决定。
making ethical decisions.

566
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:35,210
也就是说，做出具有社会，政治，
That is, making decisions which stand to have social, political,

567
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:36,612
或人类的影响。
or human impact.

568
00:25:36,612 --> 00:25:39,070
在哈佛，我们认为这对计算机科学家很重要
At Harvard, we think it's important for computer scientists

569
00:25:39,069 --> 00:25:42,729
配备用于思考这些影响的工具。
to be equipped with tools for thinking through these implications.

570
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:45,730
苏珊·肯尼迪（SUSAN KENNEDY）：技术对我们拥有强大的力量和影响力。
SUSAN KENNEDY: Technology holds a lot of power and influence over us.

571
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:49,938
从广义上讲，这意味着设计技术的人员也可以这样做。
And that means, by extension, that the people who design technology do, too.

572
00:25:49,938 --> 00:25:52,480
现在，您开始考虑什么职责
Now that you're starting to think about what responsibilities

573
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,940
您可能是计算机科学家，所以您
you might have as computer scientists, so you

574
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:58,570
可以避免明显的不幸事故，例如面部混搭，
can avoid notable mishaps, like face mash, for instance,

575
00:25:58,569 --> 00:26:01,959
我们将把您的注意力转向社交媒体平台的主题
we're going to turn your attention to the topic of social media platforms

576
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,420
以及它们如何影响和参与的分布
and how they affect the distribution of and engagement

577
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:07,010
新闻和信息。
with news and information.

578
00:26:07,009 --> 00:26:09,259
看来这个话题特别重要
It would seem that this topic is especially relevant

579
00:26:09,259 --> 00:26:13,369
现在，鉴于最近的美国总统大选，政治内容已经
now, given the recent US presidential election, where political content has

580
00:26:13,369 --> 00:26:17,119
一直主导着互联网和电视广播以及争议
been dominating the internet and television broadcasts and controversy

581
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:19,879
在社交媒体上大放异彩，赢得了关注

582
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,930
来自世界各地的。
from around the world.

583
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:24,840
毫无疑问，技术已彻底革命
Undoubtedly, technology has completely revolutionized

584
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:28,739
信息和新闻的传播和消费方式。
the way information and news is both disseminated and consumed.

585
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:32,370
不要在纸上男孩大喊大叫，而是在街角把您的新闻放在这里，
Instead of a paper boy shouting, get your news here on the street corner,

586
00:26:32,369 --> 00:26:34,589
几乎每个人都使用互联网熬夜
just about everyone uses the internet to stay up

587
00:26:34,589 --> 00:26:39,249
迄今为止，不仅发生在本地，而且发生在世界各地。
to date with what's happening, not just locally, but around the world.

588
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:42,790
在过去的几年中，尤其是社交媒体平台，
And in the past few years, social media platforms, in particular,

589
00:26:42,789 --> 00:26:46,239
在人们获取，分享，
have started to play a huge role in how people access, share,

590
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,460
并与信息互动。
and engage with information.

591
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:52,630
例如，研究表明，美国有44％的成年人
For instance, research shows that 44% of US adults

592
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:55,850
报告从Facebook获取新闻。
report getting the news from Facebook.

593
00:26:55,849 --> 00:26:58,849
可以肯定地说，近年来发生了很多变化，
It's safe to say a lot has changed in recent years,

594
00:26:58,849 --> 00:27:01,229
由于技术的发展。
owing to developments in technology.

595
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:05,030
当我们考虑关键问题时，这很重要，即能力
And this matters when we consider what's at stake, namely, the ability

596
00:27:05,029 --> 00:27:07,009
公众参与的话语
for the public to engage in discourse that

597
00:27:07,009 --> 00:27:09,949
支持运作良好的民主。
supports a well-functioning democracy.

598
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:13,280
首先，我将向您简要介绍我们的来源
So I'll first present you a brief overview of where we came from

599
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,429
以及我们现在的位置，由于技术的发展
and where we are now, owing to technological developments

600
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:20,220
然后考虑我们今天面临的挑战。
and then consider what challenges we're faced with today.

601
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,530
在上网之前，新闻和信息
Before the internet, news and information

602
00:27:22,529 --> 00:27:26,669
几乎完全掌握在几个主要广播电台和印刷品的手中
was almost entirely in the hands of a few major broadcast stations and print

603
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:31,020
媒体渠道，也称为大众媒体领域。
media outlets, otherwise known as the mass media sphere.

604
00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:34,109
由于一些组织负责传播
Since a few organizations were responsible for disseminating

605
00:27:34,109 --> 00:27:37,229
所有的新闻，信息本质上是
all the news, information was essentially

606
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:40,110
通过狭窄的镜头或狭窄的光圈过滤
filtered through a narrow lens or narrow aperture

607
00:27:40,109 --> 00:27:44,079
从组织到广大公众。
from organizations to a wide public audience.

608
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,899
负责研究和写作的记者
The journalists who are responsible for researching and writing

609
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:51,680
这些组织的内容都具有专业精神。
the content for these organizations all shared a professional ethos.

610
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,520
他们关心真理，社会团体的代表，
They were concerned with truth, representation of social groups,

611
00:27:55,519 --> 00:28:00,399
创建一个批评论坛，阐明公共价值观，
creating a forum for criticism, clarifying public values,

612
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,190
并提供全面的覆盖范围。
and offering comprehensive coverage.

613
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:05,380
尤其是因为目标是生产
And notably, since the aim was to produce

614
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,720
吸引了广大观众的内容，
content that appealed to a wide audience,

615
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:12,810
如今，我们所看到的两极分化和极端主义评论较少。
there was less polarization and extremist commentary than we see today.

616
00:28:12,809 --> 00:28:15,269
但是负责新闻报道的新闻记者
But the journalists responsible for news coverage

617
00:28:15,269 --> 00:28:17,739
在很多方面都非常统一
were very uniform in a lot of ways.

618
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:22,380
有相对富裕，受过高等教育的人，大多数是白人，男性，
There were relatively affluent, highly educated, mostly white, male,

619
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,040
等等。
and so forth.

620
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:28,169
这影响了种族政治，经济政策，
And this had effects on the coverage of racial politics, economic policy,

621
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:31,660
以及对美国在世界上的作用的看法。
and views about the role of the US in the world.

622
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:34,720
而且，观众很少有机会
Moreover, there were seldom opportunities for the audience

623
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,810
做出回应，开发新的主题或主题，
to respond, to develop new themes or topics,

624
00:28:37,809 --> 00:28:41,109
或针对大众传媒领域的批评。
or level criticism against the mass media sphere.

625
00:28:41,109 --> 00:28:43,209
没有任何喜欢和评论的部分
There weren't any likes and comment sections

626
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:46,270
用于报纸或电视广播。
for the newspaper or television broadcasts.

627
00:28:46,269 --> 00:28:49,569
如果您不喜欢它，那么，祝您好运。
If you didn't like it, well, tough luck.

628
00:28:49,569 --> 00:28:51,639
近年来，这一切开始改变，
This all started to change in recent years,

629
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:56,290
因为新闻报道不仅转移到网上，而且转移到社交媒体平台上。
as news coverage not only moved online, but onto social media platforms.

630
00:28:56,289 --> 00:28:59,829
我们现在生活在一个数字网络化的公共领域。
We now live in a digitally networked public sphere.

631
00:28:59,829 --> 00:29:03,069
因此，与其进行狭窄的交流，
So instead of having a narrow aperture of communications,

632
00:29:03,069 --> 00:29:06,939
或只有少数几个组织向公众传播信息，
or just a few organizations to disseminate information to the public,

633
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:10,600
我们现在有了一个大口径的数字领域，那里有很多人
we now have a digital sphere with a wide aperture, where lots of people

634
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:13,169
可以分享新闻和信息。
can share news and information.

635
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:15,450
更具体地说，内容的来源
More specifically, the sources of content

636
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:19,140
不仅是他们所雇用的组织和专业新闻工作者，
are not just organizations and the professional journalists they employed,

637
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,920
但公众，尤其是社交媒体用户。
but the public and particularly, social media users.

638
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:26,010
任何人都可以在Facebook上发推文或发布信息，任何人都可以
Anyone can tweet or post on Facebook, and anyone

639
00:29:26,009 --> 00:29:28,589
可以阅读这些推文和帖子。
can read those tweets and posts.

640
00:29:28,589 --> 00:29:30,629
不仅带来更大的多样性
It's not only resulted in greater diversity

641
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:34,250
内容，但也可以更好地访问信息。
of content, but greater access to information as well.

642
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:36,899
如果您想关注新闻，有很多选择
If you want to follow the news, there are a ton of options

643
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:41,500
以及在线免费场所，只需单击几下鼠标即可访问。
and free places online you can access with just a few mouse clicks.

644
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,990
增加多样性和获取机会的这些前景
These prospects of increased diversity and access

645
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:47,230
是什么导致许多人相信数字领域
are what led many people to believe that the digital sphere held

646
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:49,990
改善公众话语的巨大希望
great promise for improving the public discourse that

647
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:52,540
支持运作良好的民主。
supports a well-functioning democracy.

648
00:29:52,539 --> 00:29:55,459
在某些方面，这是事实。
And in some ways, this has been true.

649
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,930
例如，感谢Twitter和Facebook，
For example, thanks to Twitter and Facebook,

650
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:00,560
我们看到了社会正义运动的动员，
we saw the mobilization of social justice movements,

651
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,439
像我，《太黑了》和《黑色生活》
like Me, Too and Black Lives Matter.

652
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,780
并且观点的多样性增加
And the increased diversity of perspectives

653
00:30:05,779 --> 00:30:08,929
为个人研究人员和科学家提供了可能
made it possible for individual researchers and scientists

654
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:12,350
权衡CDC关于冠状病毒的主张。
to weigh in on the CDC'S claims about coronavirus.

655
00:30:12,349 --> 00:30:16,159
因此，尽管CDC最初并未说冠状病毒是特征
So while the CDC did not initially say coronavirus was characterized

656
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,363
通过空中传播，导致社区扩散，
by airborne transmission, leading to community spread,

657
00:30:19,363 --> 00:30:21,530
他们最终在科学家之后改变了自己的立场
they ended up revising their stance after scientists

658
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:25,699
拿到Twitter上的证据证明确实如此。
took to Twitter with evidence proving that this was the case.

659
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,260
尽管数字领域带来了一些进步，
While the digital sphere has brought about some improvements,

660
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:32,679
它还加剧了一些问题并带来了新的挑战。
it's also exacerbated some problems and created new challenges.

661
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:37,120
例如，由于任何人都可以创建内容，因此进行事实检查和监视
For example, since anyone can create content, fact checking and monitoring

662
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:39,454
已经变得更加困难。人们是
have become much more difficult. People are

663
00:30:39,454 --> 00:30:42,579
在弄清楚是否有东西时要自己照顾自己
left to fend for themselves when it comes to figuring out whether something

664
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:45,389
他们在网上阅读是值得信赖的。
they read online is trustworthy.

665
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:48,240
我们还看到，尊重方面的个性化程度有所提高
We've also seen increased personalization with respect

666
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,600
新闻和信息，其中特定内容可以
to news and information, where specific content could

667
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:54,869
通过精选新闻将特定用户定位为特定用户
be targeted to specific users by the means of curated news

668
00:30:54,869 --> 00:30:58,259
大量涌现社交媒体和有线电视新闻台
feeds on social media and cable news stations cropping up

669
00:30:58,259 --> 00:31:02,309
他们所报道的新闻具有特殊的角度。
that take a particular angle on the news that they cover.

670
00:31:02,309 --> 00:31:03,509
这很重要。
This is significant.

671
00:31:03,509 --> 00:31:06,659
因为我们最终会产生某种自相矛盾的效果。
Because we end up with a somewhat paradoxical effect.

672
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:09,720
尽管可用内容的多样性更大，
Despite a greater diversity in the content that's available,

673
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,390
新闻和信息人员的多样性较少
there's less diversity in the news and information people

674
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:16,650
最终最终消耗掉了，信息的个性化
actually end up consuming, with the personalization of information having

675
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:19,110
倾向于强化一个人的观点，
a tendency to reinforce a person's viewpoints,

676
00:31:19,109 --> 00:31:22,069
而不是挑战或扩大它们。
rather than challenge or broaden them.

677
00:31:22,069 --> 00:31:25,149
此外，在缺乏集中新闻来源的情况下，
Additionally, in the absence of centralized sources of news,

678
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:29,650
我们还看到了创建和共享内容所表达的不同目标。
we've also seen different aims expressed by those creating and sharing content.

679
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:33,550
一些人绕开了对真理的关注，以争取更多的观点。
Some have bypassed a concern for truth in an effort to garner more views

680
00:31:33,549 --> 00:31:37,539
并且喜欢带有极端主义内容或虚假新闻的人。
and likes with extremist content or fake news.

681
00:31:37,539 --> 00:31:39,819
假新闻在当时成为一个巨大的问题
And fake news became a huge issue around the time

682
00:31:39,819 --> 00:31:43,269
令人担忧的是2016年总统大选
of the 2016 presidential election, as there were concerns

683
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:46,329
错误信息在社交媒体上的大量传播
that the massive spread of misinformation on social media

684
00:31:46,329 --> 00:31:50,589
可能影响或影响个人的政治观点。
could influence or sway individuals political views.

685
00:31:50,589 --> 00:31:53,379
尽管错误信息的传播一直是一个问题，
While the spread of misinformation has always been an issue,

686
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:56,740
数字公共领域确实加剧了这种情况，
it's truly been exacerbated by the digital public sphere,

687
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:00,910
社交媒体平台实质上是将汽油浇在火上。
with social media platforms essentially pouring gasoline on the fire.

688
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:04,210
假新闻的传播在社交媒体上激增
The dissemination of fake news explodes on social media

689
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:07,810
因为数字环境的结构，从喜欢到转发，
because the structure of digital environments, from likes to retweets,

690
00:32:07,809 --> 00:32:10,899
允许有关假新闻的单个帖子广为传播，
allows a single post on fake news to go viral,

691
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,570
到达全世界数以百万计的屏幕。
reaching the screens of millions around the world.

692
00:32:13,569 --> 00:32:16,689
而且，对于假新闻如何发挥作用也存在严重的担忧
And there are serious worries about how fake news has played a role

693
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:20,200
加剧政治上的两极分化。
in amplifying political polarization.

694
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,350
因此，尽管技术带来了独特的优势，
So while technology has made possible unique advantages,

695
00:32:23,349 --> 00:32:26,079
它也带来了独特的挑战。
it's also brought on unique challenges.

696
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:28,419
我们现在面临的一个主要问题
One major question that we're faced with now

697
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:32,800
正在研究如何在社交媒体平台上对内容进行监管，
is figuring out how content should be regulated on social media platforms,

698
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,269
如果有的话。
if at all.

699
00:32:34,269 --> 00:32:37,179
考虑到问题的严重性，有些人可能会持怀疑态度，
Given the scale of the problem, some might be skeptical,

700
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:40,760
认为任何形式的内容监管都是不可能的。
believing that any form of content regulation would be impossible.

701
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:43,659
在线发布的人太多，无法对所有事实进行事实检查。
There's just too many people posting online to fact check them all.

702
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:46,990
假新闻传播如此之快，很难在它已经停止之前停止
And fake news spreads so quickly, it's hard to stop before it's already

703
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:49,280
吸引了很多观众
reached a huge audience.

704
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:51,259
还有担心会试图调节
There's also worries that attempts to regulate

705
00:32:51,259 --> 00:32:54,739
内容最终可能会成为一种违背审查制度的形式
content could end up becoming a form of censorship that violates

706
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:57,380
言论自由权。
the right to freedom of speech.

707
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:00,020
但是有些人对这种可能性更加乐观
But some people are more optimistic about the possibilities

708
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:03,619
以促进和保存的方式设计社交媒体平台的过程
of designing social media platforms in a way that promotes and preserves

709
00:33:03,619 --> 00:33:05,299
民主。
democracy.

710
00:33:05,299 --> 00:33:08,509
特别是，负责任的设计
In particular, there's a possibility that with responsibly designed

711
00:33:08,509 --> 00:33:11,299
算法和用户界面选择，我们
algorithms and user interface choices, we

712
00:33:11,299 --> 00:33:13,309
也许能够减缓虚假新闻的传播
might be able to slow the spread of fake news

713
00:33:13,309 --> 00:33:17,149
并从总体上改善信息的传播和参与方式
and more generally improve the ways information is disseminated and engaged

714
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:19,410
与社交媒体上。
with on social media.

715
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:23,340
例如，有些人认为Facebook，Twitter等公司
For example, some people believe that companies like Facebook, Twitter

716
00:33:23,339 --> 00:33:26,339
YouTube负责规范内容
and YouTube have a responsibility to regulate content

717
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:29,459
因为他们对我们有巨大的影响。
because of the enormous influence they have over us.

718
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:33,300
特别是，人们认为社交媒体平台有责任
In particular, it's thought that social media platforms have a responsibility

719
00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:37,139
警戒虚假新闻并降低数据驱动算法的功能
to police fake news and reduce the power of data driven algorithms that

720
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,590
个性化用户体验，即使这样做
personalize the user experience, even if doing these things

721
00:33:40,589 --> 00:33:42,959
将以用户参与为代价，
would come at the cost of user engagement,

722
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,330
从而减少了在平台上花费的时间，并减少了广告收入。
resulting in less time spent on the platform and less advertising revenue.

723
00:33:48,329 --> 00:33:50,369
显然，就此而言，前进的道路
It's clear that the path going forward in terms

724
00:33:50,369 --> 00:33:54,629
社交媒体平台上的内容监管将非常棘手。
of content regulation on social media platforms is going to be tricky.

725
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:57,600
我们是否提倡民主理想或破坏民主理想
Whether or not we promote democratic ideals or undermine

726
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:01,669
他们将取决于我们做出的特定设计选择。
them will come down to the particular design choices we make.

727
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:04,070
为了使用技术创造解决方案
In order to use technology to create solutions

728
00:34:04,069 --> 00:34:06,319
面对我们今天面临的问题，我们将
to the problems we're facing today, we'll

729
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:08,968
需要就设计选择做出明智的决定。
need to make informed decisions about design choices.

730
00:34:08,969 --> 00:34:12,620
这需要对道德和哲学进行批判性思考
And this requires some critical thinking about ethics and philosophy

731
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:15,129
找出执行此操作的最佳方法。
to figure out the best way to do this.

732
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:17,815
但是我们希望像您一样的学生参加CS50，
But we're hoping that students like you, taking CS50,

733
00:34:17,815 --> 00:34:21,594
可以利用您的创造力，技术知识和道德推理
can harness your creativity, technical knowledge, and ethical reasoning

734
00:34:21,594 --> 00:34:25,703
以负责任的方式设计技术。
to design technology in a responsible way.

735
00:34:25,702 --> 00:34:27,619
所以我现在要把事情交给梅卡，
So I'm now going to pass things over to Meica,

736
00:34:27,619 --> 00:34:30,399
谁会告诉你一些哲学概念
who will tell you about some philosophical concepts that'll

737
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,679
帮助您主动思考特定的设计
help you think proactively about particular design

738
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:36,550
可以实现结构的选择和算法工具
choices and algorithmic tools that can be implemented to structure

739
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:40,960
社交媒体平台，以促进民主公众话语的方式。
social media platforms in a way that promotes democratic public discourse.

740
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,420
MEICA MAGNANI：在民主与数字公共领域，
MEICA MAGNANI: In Democracy and The Digital Public Sphere,

741
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:46,900
一篇可以很好地诊断我们情况的文章，
an article which offers a fantastic diagnosis of our situation,

742
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,000
苏珊和我从中大量汲取金钱
and from which Susan and I are drawing heavily

743
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,080
在本次演讲中，作者约书亚·科恩（Joshua Cohen）和冯宗Arch（Archon Fung）
upon for this lecture, the authors Joshua Cohen and Archon Fung,

744
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:56,408
告诉我们，数字玫瑰绽放了。
tell us that the bloom is off the digital rose.

745
00:34:56,409 --> 00:34:58,840
正如苏珊（Susan）所描述的，我们寄予厚望
As Susan was describing, we had such high hopes

746
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:02,200
为社交媒体和互联网的民主化潜力。
for the democratizing potential of social media and the internet.

747
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:05,739
但是现在我们面临假新闻泛滥的环境，
But now we face an environment in which fake news runs rampant,

748
00:35:05,739 --> 00:35:08,379
市民似乎两极分化，
citizens appear to be dramatically polarized,

749
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:11,020
信息在它自己的孤立气泡中回旋，
information swirls in its own isolated bubbles,

750
00:35:11,019 --> 00:35:14,139
仇恨言论达到令人震惊的硫酸水平。
and hate speech reaches appalling levels of vitriol.

751
00:35:14,139 --> 00:35:17,439
所有这些都会威胁到人们的猜测，
All of which stand to threaten, or so people speculate,

752
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,290
有效民主所需的条件。
the conditions required for an effective democracy.

753
00:35:20,289 --> 00:35:23,499
所以出现以下问题，以什么方式
So the following questions arise, in what ways

754
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,720
民主的条件受到威胁吗？
are the conditions of democracy threatened?

755
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:27,579
对此可以或应该做些什么？
What can or should be done about it?

756
00:35:27,579 --> 00:35:29,919
我们的技术结构负责吗？
Is the structure of our technology responsible?

757
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,610
还是我们作为人类创造了这些问题？
Or is it just us, as human beings, creating these problems?

758
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:35,830
在本模块中，我们将重点关注
In this module, we're focusing specifically

759
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:38,139
关于内容监管的问题。
on the issue of content regulation.

760
00:35:38,139 --> 00:35:40,959
社交媒体公司，例如Twitter，Facebook和YouTube
Social media companies like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube

761
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,200
现在都在尝试通过平台解决这些问题
are now all in the game of trying to address these problems through platform

762
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:45,969
设计和功能。
design and features.

763
00:35:45,969 --> 00:35:49,749
从一个角度来看，他们正在为维护民主服务
From one angle then, they are acting in the service of protecting democracy

764
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:52,959
通过试图控制错误信息的传播，
by trying to get control over the spread of misinformation,

765
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,530
仇恨言论的放大和两极分化的加深。
the amplification of hate speech, and the deepening of polarization.

766
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:58,810
但是，从另一个角度来看，他们正在介入
However, from another angle, they're stepping in

767
00:35:58,809 --> 00:36:01,219
塑造信息的分布。
to shape the distribution of information.

768
00:36:01,219 --> 00:36:03,519
根据特定的设计选择，
And depending on the particular design choices,

769
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:05,559
可能被设置为调节或沉默
might be set to be regulating or silencing

770
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:09,309
演讲，这当然与民主承诺背道而驰
speech, which of course, is at odds with democratic commitments

771
00:36:09,309 --> 00:36:11,589
言论自由和话语权。
to free speech and discourse.

772
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:14,170
然后，本模块的重点是为您提供一些工具
The point of this module, then, is to give you some tools

773
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:18,040
思考这些问题，了解问题的工具，
to think through these issues, tools for understanding the problem,

774
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:22,509
诊断问题的根源，并集思广益。
diagnosing the sources of the problem, and brainstorming solutions.

775
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:24,640
在剩下的10或15分钟内，我要去
In the remaining 10 or 15 minutes, I'm going

776
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:27,079
提供主要工具的概述
to provide an overview of the main tools which

777
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:29,199
您将在阅读材料中找到详细信息。
you will find detailed in the readings.

778
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:33,349
它们也是您将需要在本周的实验室中进行分析的工具。
They are also the tools you will be asked to analyze in this week's lab.

779
00:36:33,349 --> 00:36:35,619
所以首先，我们需要清楚地考虑一下
So first then, we need to think clearly about what

780
00:36:35,619 --> 00:36:37,869
健康的民主是必需的。
is required for a healthy democracy.

781
00:36:37,869 --> 00:36:42,039
如果我们要宣称技术如何威胁民主，
If we're going to be making claims about how tech threatens democracy,

782
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:46,749
我们更好地了解A，什么是民主，B，什么样的条件
we better understand A, what a democracy is, and B, what sort of conditions

783
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:50,860
支持民主，使这些条件可能受到威胁。
support democracy, such that those conditions could come under threat.

784
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:54,610
政治学教授冯宗宪在他们的文章中
In their article, Archon Fung, who is a professor in political science

785
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:58,900
在哈佛大学和政治哲学家约书亚·科恩（Joshua Cohen）一起工作
here at Harvard, and Joshua Cohen, who is a political philosopher now working

786
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:03,800
与苹果大学的教职员工一起，为我们提供这些工具。
with the faculty at Apple University, provide us with these tools.

787
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,070
因此，在民主理念背后是理想的选择
So behind the idea of democracy is an ideal

788
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:08,170
政治社会应该是什么。
of what political society should be.

789
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:11,810
冯和科恩将此理想简化为三个要素。
Fung and Cohen reduce this ideal to three elements.

790
00:37:11,809 --> 00:37:15,609
首先，民主社会的思想
First, the idea of a democratic society, a society

791
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:19,982
政治文化将个人视为自由和平等。
in which the political culture views individuals as free and equal.

792
00:37:19,981 --> 00:37:21,939
即使这些人可能
Even though it is likely that these people have

793
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:25,900
不同的利益，身份和信仰体系，作为公民，
different interests, identities, and systems of belief, as citizens,

794
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:30,040
他们致力于通过反思和话语到达原则
they are committed to arriving m through reflection and discourse, principles

795
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:33,039
这将使他们能够在尊重自由的同时共同努力
that will enable them to work together while respecting their freedom

796
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:35,039
和平等。
and equality.

797
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:38,399
其次是民主政治体制的思想，
Second is the idea of a democratic political regime, which

798
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,060
其特点是定期选举，参与权，
is characterized by regular elections, rights of participation,

799
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:44,159
以及关联权和表达权
along with associative and expressive rights

800
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:48,219
使参与既有见地又有效。
that make participation both informed and effective.

801
00:37:48,219 --> 00:37:52,029
第三，最后是协商民主的思想，
Third and lastly is the idea of a deliberative democracy,

802
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:54,130
根据哪个政治讨论
according to which political discussion should

803
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:56,620
诉诸适合合作的理由
appeal to reasons that are suitable for cooperation

804
00:37:56,619 --> 00:38:00,069
自由平等的人之间。
amongst free and equal persons.

805
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:04,330
因此，在为一项政策辩护时，您不能诉诸于自己的宗教信仰，
So in justifying a policy, you cannot appeal to, say, your own religion,

806
00:38:04,329 --> 00:38:07,659
鉴于其他人不一定持有相同的信念。
given that others do not necessarily hold those same beliefs.

807
00:38:07,659 --> 00:38:10,899
您可以诉诸宗教自由的概念，但不能
You can appeal to the notion of, say, religious freedom, but not

808
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:14,990
宗教本身所包含的特定信仰。
the particular beliefs contained within the religion itself.

809
00:38:14,989 --> 00:38:17,439
因此，民主基本上是一种理想
So democracy, then, is basically an ideal

810
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,920
我们通过集体决策来控制自己，
that we govern ourselves by collective decision making, decision making that

811
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,200
尊重我们的自由与平等。
respects our freedom and equality.

812
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:26,979
这项决策不仅包括正式的投票程序，
This decision making consists not only of the formal procedures of voting,

813
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:31,750
选举和立法，也由非正式的公共领域提供信息，
elections, and legislation, it is also informed by the informal public sphere,

814
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:35,140
也就是说，公民发现问题和关切，
that is, citizens identifying problems and concerns,

815
00:38:35,139 --> 00:38:38,889
讨论和辩论问题，表达意见，挑战
discussing and debating problems, expressing opinions, challenging

816
00:38:38,889 --> 00:38:41,589
观点，并围绕原因进行组织。
viewpoints, and organizing around causes.

817
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:45,850
这是民主决策过程中绝对关键的部分。
This is an absolutely critical part of the democratic decision-making process.

818
00:38:45,849 --> 00:38:51,009
在这里，我们作为公众形成，测试，分散，交流，
It is where we, as the public, form, test, disperse, exchange,

819
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:53,290
挑战，并修改我们的观点。
challenge, and revise our views.

820
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:56,079
信息流以及用户参与度
The flow of information, along with user engagement

821
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:58,509
在Facebook，YouTube和Twitter上都是
on Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter, are all part

822
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:01,740
这个非正式的公共领域。
of this informal public sphere.

823
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,839
为了个人可以参与
In order that individuals can participate

824
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:07,200
在这个公共演讲舞台上作为自由和平等的公民，
as free and equal citizens in this arena of public discourse,

825
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:10,139
Cohen和Fung提出了一系列权利和机会
Cohen and Fung lay out a set of rights and opportunities

826
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:12,929
一个运作良好的民主国家将需要的。
that a well-functioning democracy will require.

827
00:39:12,929 --> 00:39:15,899
这些是提供的分析工具。
And these are the tools of analysis on offer.

828
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,030
首先，权利。
So first, rights.

829
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:20,610
“作为民主国家的公民，我们享有权利
"As citizens of a democracy, we have rights

830
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:24,930
基本自由，表达自由和结社自由。
to basic liberties, liberties of expression and association.

831
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:27,089
表达自由权很重要
The right to expressive liberty is important

832
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:29,160
不仅为了个人的自由，
not only for the freedom of the individual,

833
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:33,519
这样他或她就不会受到审查，而且也会受到民主本身的审查。
so that he or she will not be censored, but also for democracy itself.

834
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:37,409
它使公民能够将他们的想法相互交流
It enables citizens to bring their ideas into conversation with one another

835
00:39:37,409 --> 00:39:41,249
并批评和追究行使权力的人。”
and to criticize and hold accountable those who exercise power."

836
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:44,700
第二是表达的机会。
Second is the opportunity for expression.

837
00:39:44,699 --> 00:39:47,039
“我们不仅应该不受审查，而且
"Not only should we be free of censorship, but

838
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:50,939
我们应该有公平的机会参加公开讨论。
we should have fair opportunity to participate in public discussion.

839
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,190
并非应该因为某人是这样，
It shouldn't be the case that because someone is, say,

840
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:58,260
富裕或更强大，他们就有更多参与的机会。”
wealthier or more powerful, that they have more opportunity to participate."

841
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,390
第三是访问。
Third is access.

842
00:40:00,389 --> 00:40:03,149
“每个人都应享有平等的机会
"Each person should have good and equal access

843
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:06,540
获得有关公共事务的质量可靠的信息。
to quality and reliable information on public matters.

844
00:40:06,539 --> 00:40:08,639
也就是说，如果我们付出努力，我们应该
That is, if we make the effort, we should

845
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:10,689
能够获取此信息。
be able to acquire this information.

846
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:16,200
有效参与决策需要知情。”
Effective participation in decision making requires being informed."

847
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:18,539
第四是多样性。
Fourth is diversity.

848
00:40:18,539 --> 00:40:23,069
“每个人都应该有平等机会听取各种各样的意见。
"Each person should have good and equal chances to hear a wide range of views.

849
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:25,440
我们需要获得竞争观点才能拥有
We need access to competing views in order to have

850
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,410
更加明智和理性的立场”
a more informed and reasoned position"

851
00:40:28,409 --> 00:40:31,619
最后，第五，沟通能力。
And lastly, number five, communicative power.

852
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:35,879
“公民应有平等机会探索兴趣和思想
"Citizens should have good and equal chances to explore interests and ideas

853
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,570
与他人合作。
in association with others.

854
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:40,710
通过这些协会，发展出新的关注点，
And through these associations, to develop new concerns that

855
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:44,120
可能会挑战主流观点。”
might challenge the mainstream view."

856
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:47,359
这些权利和机会共同提供了关键条件
These rights and opportunities together provide critical conditions

857
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,360
使人们能够参与公共讨论。
for enabling participation in public discussion.

858
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:53,120
他们可能需要跟踪很多东西，
They might seem like a lot to keep track of initially,

859
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,419
但是如果我们要思考一下社交媒体如何威胁民主，
but if we're going to think through how social media threatens democracy,

860
00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:00,210
更具体地说，平台设计如何促进或阻碍民主，
and more concretely, how platform design might promote or hinder democracy,

861
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:01,910
这些都是有价值的工具。
these are valuable tools.

862
00:41:01,909 --> 00:41:04,699
我们可以使用访问条件，想法
We can use, say, the access condition, the idea

863
00:41:04,699 --> 00:41:07,279
我们所有人都应该能够获得可靠的信息，
that we should all have access to reliable information,

864
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,470
作为分析的镜头。
as a lens of analysis.

865
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:11,839
我们的平台是否阻止某些群体或用户
Does our platform prevent certain groups or users

866
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,270
从访问可靠的信息？
from accessing reliable information?

867
00:41:14,269 --> 00:41:17,269
或者我们可以使用多样性条件
Or we can use the diversity condition, the idea

868
00:41:17,269 --> 00:41:20,179
我们所有人都应该可以访问多种矛盾的观点
that we should all have access to a plurality of conflicting views

869
00:41:20,179 --> 00:41:22,019
作为分析的镜头。
as a lens of analysis.

870
00:41:22,019 --> 00:41:25,639
例如，我们可能会问自己，我们的平台是否
So for example, we might ask ourselves, does our platform

871
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:28,879
创建一个过滤泡，使个人不再面对
create a filter bubble in which individuals are no longer confronted

872
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,610
有反对意见？
with opposing views?

873
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:34,100
除了了解什么条件支持
In addition to understanding what conditions support

874
00:41:34,099 --> 00:41:38,689
一个民主社会，我们还需要了解所谓的问题
a democratic society, we also need to understand the purported problems

875
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:42,010
在我们提出有效的干预措施之前。
before we can propose effective interventions.

876
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:43,720
考虑假新闻。
Consider fake news.

877
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:47,079
当涉及到假新闻时，为什么人们这么容易被骗呢？
Why are people so gullible when it comes to fake news?

878
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:51,489
为什么他们经常在没有适当的严格评估的情况下重新发布？
Why do they often repost without proper critical assessment?

879
00:41:51,489 --> 00:41:54,489
里贾纳·里尼（Regina Rini）在阅读中建议
Regina Rini, in the reading, proposes that in order

880
00:41:54,489 --> 00:41:56,619
了解假新闻现象，
to understand the phenomenon of fake news,

881
00:41:56,619 --> 00:41:59,779
我们应该把它当作证词的一种形式。
we should think about it as a form of testimony.

882
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,780
当其他人与您共享信息时，
When another person shares information with you,

883
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:04,310
您通常会认为它是真实的。
you typically take it to be true.

884
00:42:04,309 --> 00:42:07,239
这是因为规范我们作证行为的准则。
This is because of the norms governing our practice of testimony.

885
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:09,939
当您断言某些东西，并将其传递给其他人时，
When you assert something, passing it on to others,

886
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:12,580
您通常会对它的真实性负责。
you typically take responsibility for its truth.

887
00:42:12,579 --> 00:42:15,159
假设您已获得证据
It is assumed that you have either acquired evidence

888
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:18,459
为您自己，或者您已从某个来源收到此信息
for yourself or you've received this information from a source

889
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:20,440
您认为可靠。
that you deem reliable.

890
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,710
我们对世界的大部分了解都来自这种实践。
Most of our knowledge about the world comes through this practice.

891
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:27,280
我们不可能获得所有我们持有的信念的证据。
We could not possibly acquire evidence for all the beliefs we hold.

892
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,860
因此，我们常常不得不依靠我们认为并希望可信的资源。
So we often have to rely on sources we deem and hope to be credible.

893
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:36,690
但里尼指出，社交媒体尚未制定出推荐规范。
But social media, Rini points out, has unsettled testimonial norms.

894
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:41,670
当某人发布一条新闻时，我们似乎持有两种相互矛盾的观点。
When someone posts a piece of news, we seem to hold two conflicting views.

895
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:44,730
一方面，我们认为这是积极的认可。
On the one hand, we see it as an active endorsement.

896
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:48,660
发布者已承担了一定程度的责任
The person posting has taken some degree of responsibility

897
00:42:48,659 --> 00:42:51,209
为了他们的帖子的准确性，以相同的方式之一
for the accuracy of their post, the same way one

898
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:54,480
在进行对话之前传递信息。
would before passing on information in a conversation.

899
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,240
但另一方面，这只是一部分。
On the other hand, though, it's just a share.

900
00:42:57,239 --> 00:43:00,479
当唐纳德·特朗普大声疾呼时，我们会看到这种态度
We see this attitude coming through when Donald Trump, called out

901
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:06,060
在他的一条可疑推文中，用eh反驳，这只是一条推文。
on one of his questionable tweets, retorts with, eh, it's just a tweet.

902
00:43:06,059 --> 00:43:09,089
为了打击假新闻，Rini认为我们
To fight fake news, then, Rini argues that we

903
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:13,440
需要稳定社交媒体的证词规范，以便如她所说，
need to stabilize social media's norms of testimony so that, as she says,

904
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,870
保持我们对鸡尾酒诚实的相同准则
the same norms that keep us honest over cocktails

905
00:43:15,869 --> 00:43:18,149
将使我们对自己的职位保持诚实。
will keep us honest in our posts.

906
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:20,340
我们需要对人们负责，
We need people to be held accountable for,

907
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:22,920
或对信息负有责任感
or to have a sense of responsibility, for the information

908
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,840
他们与他人分享。
that they share with others.

909
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:29,650
她的具体建议，给用户一个信誉分数。
Her concrete proposal, give users a credibility score.

910
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:33,300
因此，实际上，这将是对Facebook系统的修正，
So in practice, this would be an amendment to Facebook's system,

911
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,910
使用独立的事实检查组织，
using independent fact checking organizations,

912
00:43:35,909 --> 00:43:41,459
Facebook会标记有问题的新闻，并在用户重新发布之前警告用户。
Facebook flags problematic news and warns users before they repost it.

913
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:44,280
当用户尝试发布已确定的内容时
When a user tries to post something that has been identified

914
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:47,760
如果是错误或误导性内容，则会出现一个弹出窗口，说明问题所在
as false or misleading, a pop up appears that explains the problem

915
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,930
并标识原始来源。
and identifies the original source.

916
00:43:49,929 --> 00:43:51,929
然后，它要求用户确认他们会
It then asks the user to confirm that they would

917
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:54,619
喜欢继续他们的转发。
like to continue with their repost.

918
00:43:54,619 --> 00:43:57,689
对于Rini，用户的信誉分数将
A user's credibility score, for Rini, would

919
00:43:57,690 --> 00:44:00,450
取决于他们选择忽略这些警告的频率
depend on how often they choose to ignore these warnings

920
00:44:00,449 --> 00:44:02,819
并传递误导性信息。
and pass on misleading information.

921
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:05,220
引用，“用户名旁边的绿点可以
Quote, "a green dot by the user's name could

922
00:44:05,219 --> 00:44:08,819
表示用户未选择分享很多有争议的新闻。
indicate that the user hasn't chosen to share much disputed news.

923
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:11,250
黄点可能表示他们有时会这样做。
A yellow dot could indicate that they do it sometimes.

924
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:13,350
红色可能表明他们经常这样做。”
And a red could indicate that they do it often."

925
00:44:13,349 --> 00:44:14,669
取消报价。
Unquote.

926
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:16,710
那么，想法就是信誉分数
The idea, then, is that a credibility score

927
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:18,960
会激励用户承担责任
would incentivize users to take responsibility

928
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,470
他们分享的东西，也会使别人对他们的信赖感
for what they share and would also give others a sense of their reliability

929
00:44:22,469 --> 00:44:24,689
作为来源。
as sources.

930
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:27,540
因此，Rini经过仔细分析后提出了此解决方案
So Rini comes up with this solution through a careful analysis

931
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:30,239
为什么我们如此容易冒充假新闻。
of why we are so gullible to fake news.

932
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:33,089
我留给你考虑这个建议
I will leave it up to you to consider this proposal

933
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:35,730
根据所需的各种权利和机会
in light of the various rights and opportunities required

934
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:38,010
民主的公共领域。
for a democratic public sphere.

935
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:41,190
里尼的提议是否侵犯或威胁了言论自由？
Does Rini's proposal violate or threaten freedom of expression?

936
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:45,000
它是否促进或阻碍了我们对可靠信息的访问，我们的访问
Does it promote or hinder our access to reliable information, our access

937
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,299
观点的多样性，还是促进或阻碍了
to diversity of views, or does it promote or hinder

938
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:50,190
我们的沟通能力？
our communicative power?

939
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:51,990
我们希望这些问题是
It is these sorts of questions that we hope

940
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:54,031
在思考时会开始问自己
that you will start to ask yourself when thinking

941
00:44:54,032 --> 00:44:56,760
通过以下问题。
through the following sorts of issues.

942
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:00,520
假新闻，仇恨言论，两极分化等问题会发生什么
What problems do fake news, hate speech, polarization, et cetera

943
00:45:00,519 --> 00:45:02,549
对民主构成？
pose to democracy?

944
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:05,830
Twitter，YouTube，
How successful are various attempts by companies like Twitter, YouTube,

945
00:45:05,829 --> 00:45:08,369
和Facebook解决这些问题？
and Facebook to address these problems?

946
00:45:08,369 --> 00:45:11,399
以及社交媒体平台的特定设计功能如何
And how might particular design features of social media platforms

947
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:15,180
促进或阻碍这些特殊的权利和机会？
promote or hinder these particular rights and opportunities?

948
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:18,749
无论是作为未来的计算机科学家，技术行业的领导者，
Whether as a future computer scientist, a tech industry leader,

949
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:22,950
或只是作为这些技术的用户，我们希望问这些问题
or just as a user of these technologies, we hope asking these sorts of questions

950
00:45:22,949 --> 00:45:25,782
将帮助您更审慎地解决这些棘手的问题。
will help you navigate these tricky issues with a more critical eye.

951
00:45:25,782 --> 00:45:28,866
苏珊·肯尼迪：我们真的很期待各种各样的设计选择
SUSAN KENNEDY: We're really looking forward to the sorts of design choices

952
00:45:28,867 --> 00:45:30,850
你将来会做的。
that you'll be making in the future.

953
00:45:30,849 --> 00:45:31,199
MEICA MAGNANI：太好了。
MEICA MAGNANI: Great.

954
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:32,866
非常感谢您今天有我们来这里。
Thanks so much for having us here today.

DAVID MALAN：好的，非常感谢Susan和Meica加入我们的行列。
DAVID MALAN: Well, thank you so much to Susan and Meica for joining us.

957
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:41,510
确实，在接下来的一周的实验中，我们将有机会
Indeed, in this coming week's lab, we'll have an opportunity

958
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:44,050
在一些非常大的背景下考虑其中的一些问题
to consider some of these issues in the context of some very

959
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:46,730
特定的现实世界场景。
specific real world scenarios.

960
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:49,690
因此，我们现在认为我们将期待您可以做的事情
So we now thought we would take a look forward at what you can do

961
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:52,300
以及CS50之后的处理方式
and how you can do it after CS50 when it comes

962
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:56,530
超出了计算思维本身的实际范围。
to the more practical side of things beyond computational thinking alone.

963
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:58,910
因此，当然，对于许多人来说，
So programming, of course, for many of you,

964
00:45:58,909 --> 00:46:02,126
这将是设计使然的唯一计算机科学或编程课程
this will be by design the only computer science or programming course

965
00:46:02,126 --> 00:46:02,709
你拿的。
that you take.

966
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:04,030
那当然可以。
And that's certainly OK.

967
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:06,130
确实，我们希望您现在能够返回
Indeed, we hope that you'll be able now to return

968
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:09,970
您对艺术和人文科学，社会科学感兴趣的领域，
to your own domains of interest in the arts and humanities, social sciences,

969
00:46:09,969 --> 00:46:13,839
或科学，实际上能够拥有一套具体的实践技能
or sciences and actually be able to have a concrete set of practical skills

970
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,630
是使用Python还是C或任何其他技术语言编写的
be it in Python or C or any of the other technical languages

971
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:20,470
我们研究并可以实际解决您自己喜欢的领域中的问题。
we looked at and can actually solve problems in your own preferred domain.

972
00:46:20,469 --> 00:46:23,139
如果您有兴趣了解有关计算机科学的更多信息
And if you're interested in learning more about computer science

973
00:46:23,139 --> 00:46:25,329
本身，并在那个世界上前进，我们希望
itself and moving on in that world, we hope

974
00:46:25,329 --> 00:46:27,399
您将拥有坚实的基础
that you'll walk away with a solid foundation

975
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:32,800
以便对该特定领域进行进一步的理论和系统探索。
for further theoretical and systematic explorations of this particular field.

976
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,720
但实际上，我们希望现在
But very practically speaking, we hope now

977
00:46:34,719 --> 00:46:38,229
这样，您不仅可以编程，而且可以更好地提出问题，
that you can not only program, but also ask questions better,

978
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:41,240
无论是在技术世界还是在现实世界中。
whether that's in the technical world or even in just the real world.

979
00:46:41,239 --> 00:46:44,809
奇怪的是，如果您曾经在CS50的论坛上提问，
Odds are, if you've ever asked a question on CS50's discussion forums,

980
00:46:44,809 --> 00:46:48,039
老师或我可能很好地回答了问题
the teaching fellows or I might have very well responded with questions

981
00:46:48,039 --> 00:46:49,209
请您澄清一下。
asking you to clarify.

982
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:52,090
或者更好的是，您会在预期中为我们提供，
Or better yet, you would have provided us, in anticipation,

983
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:55,000
回答我们可能遇到的所有问题。
with answers to all of the questions that we might have.

984
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,949
如果您在Ed上注意到了，我们特意
And if you've noticed on Ed, we deliberately

985
00:46:56,949 --> 00:46:59,229
有这样的模板，您可以通过
have this sort of template via which you're

986
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:02,242
哄着回答，您看到的是什么症状？
coaxed to answer, well, what are the symptoms that you are seeing?

987
00:47:02,242 --> 00:47:04,450
您遇到的错误消息是什么？
What's the error message that you're struggling with?

988
00:47:04,449 --> 00:47:06,669
您尝试采取什么步骤解决此问题？
What steps have you tried to resolve the problem?

989
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:09,295
因为如果我们在现实世界中进行想象，即使只是伸出手
Because if we imagine in the real world, even just reaching out

990
00:47:09,295 --> 00:47:11,860
到一些随机公司的客户服务热线，
to some random company's customer service line,

991
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:14,450
这些恰恰是别人提出的那种问题
those are exactly the kinds of questions that someone else

992
00:47:14,449 --> 00:47:16,449
将不得不请你更好地了解
is going to have to ask you to better understand

993
00:47:16,449 --> 00:47:18,709
从您自己的角度来看问题。
a problem from your own perspective.

994
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:22,270
因此，当您从CS50本身诞生时，我们鼓励您考虑一下，
And so we would encourage you to think about, as you emerge from CS50 itself,

995
00:47:22,269 --> 00:47:24,549
只是如何向人们提出更好的问题。
just how to ask better questions of people.

996
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,420
如果您有比他们更多的信息，
If you've got more information than they,

997
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:29,950
您如何简洁却正确地将信息传达给他们
how can you succinctly but correctly convey that information to them

998
00:47:29,949 --> 00:47:32,709
以便他们可以更有效地帮助您。
so that they can help you more efficiently.

999
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:34,120
而且，找到答案。
But also, finding answers.

1000
00:47:34,119 --> 00:47:39,969
就像，我们绝对理解CS50的许多周，CS50的所有周，
Like, we absolutely understand that many of CS50's weeks, all of CS50's weeks,

1001
00:47:39,969 --> 00:47:42,117
也许，已经很无奈了。
maybe, have been quite the frustration.

1002
00:47:42,117 --> 00:47:45,159
因为您经常会觉得，好吧，我们在讲座中没有涉及到这一点。
Because you quite often feel like, well, we didn't cover that in lecture.

1003
00:47:45,159 --> 00:47:46,719
或者我没有在本节中看到这一点。
Or I didn't see that in section.

1004
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:48,279
我看到头有些点头。
And I see some noddings of the head.

1005
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,690
因此，似乎是这种情况。
So this seems to be the case.

1006
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:52,870
就像我很想保证的那样，
And much as I would love to reassure otherwise, like,

1007
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:54,579
这是非常有意图的。
that was very much the intent.

1008
00:47:54,579 --> 00:47:57,789
因为像这样的任何课程的最后一个训练轮
Because the last of the training wheels of any course like this

1009
00:47:57,789 --> 00:47:59,639
现在真的确实正式起飞了。
now really do officially come off.

1010
00:47:59,639 --> 00:48:01,389
在接下来的几周中，我们仍然
And in the coming weeks, while we'll still

1011
00:48:01,389 --> 00:48:03,781
与您一起为最终项目助一臂之力
be with you to lend a hand with final projects

1012
00:48:03,782 --> 00:48:05,740
并按照这些思路回答问题，
and answer questions along those lines, there's

1013
00:48:05,739 --> 00:48:09,969
当然，最终项目的规范没有告诉您确切的操作，
of course no specification for the final project telling you exactly what to do,

1014
00:48:09,969 --> 00:48:12,779
或使用哪种语言或使用哪种库。
or in what language to do it, or what libraries to use.

1015
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:14,530
无疑，在接下来的几周中，您将
Undoubtedly, in the coming weeks, you will

1016
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:16,870
遇到以前从未见过的错误消息。
run into error messages you haven't even seen before.

1017
00:48:16,869 --> 00:48:20,379
坦白说，也许我，也许布莱恩，也许是助教，
And frankly, maybe I, maybe Brian, maybe the teaching assistants,

1018
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:23,260
而且课程助理甚至从未见过这些错误。
and the course assistants haven't even seen those errors before.

1019
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:26,470
但是，当然，目标是以某种方式使您克服这些障碍
But the goal, of course, is to get you over those hurdles in a way

1020
00:48:26,469 --> 00:48:29,049
您可以找出如何自行执行这些操作的方法。
that you can figure out how to do those things on your own.

1021
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:32,380
因此，仅使用互联网时，无论是Google还是Stack
And so when it comes to just using the internet, be it Google, or Stack

1022
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:34,360
溢出或与其他人互动，
Overflow, or interacting with other humans,

1023
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:37,870
只是在编程世界中找到答案
just finding answers when it comes to the world of programming

1024
00:48:37,869 --> 00:48:41,799
或实际上只是更广泛地解决问题的世界，
or really just the world of problem solving more generally,

1025
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:44,450
我们希望这实际上是一种持久的技能。
we hope that is actually a lasting skill.

1026
00:48:44,449 --> 00:48:48,039
我们希望您能够做到无可奈何地做到这一点，
And we hope that you've been able to do that with admittedly frustration,

1027
00:48:48,039 --> 00:48:51,319
但是这几个月来，您的课程都拥有安全网。
but with the safety net of the course underneath you all these months.

1028
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:55,180
但是，从现在开始，我们希望您再舒适一点，再舒服一点
But here on out, we hope you'll be more comfortable, again, being uncomfortable

1029
00:48:55,179 --> 00:48:56,971
当您发现新事物时。
as you figure out new things.

1030
00:48:56,972 --> 00:48:58,930
其中一部分只是阅读文档。
And part of that is just reading documentation.

1031
00:48:58,929 --> 00:49:02,439
在这里，这也是一种挫败感，它很可能永远不会消失。
And here, too, this is a frustration that may very well never go away.

1032
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:06,430
像是某些语言或库的一些文档，
Like, some documentation out there for certain languages or libraries, just

1033
00:49:06,429 --> 00:49:07,149
不好
isn't good.

1034
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:10,630
它是由那些不认为的人写的
It was written by people that just don't think

1035
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:14,780
像您或我一样，不要以您所希望的同理心思考。
like you or I do, don't think with the same form of empathy as you might hope.

1036
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:18,100
因此，它是在非常低的技术细节水平下编写的，
And therefore, it's written at a very low level of technical detail,

1037
00:49:18,099 --> 00:49:20,469
而且他们不仅仅告诉您该函数的作用。
and they don't just tell you what does the function do.

1038
00:49:20,469 --> 00:49:23,139
或者相反，它写得太高了，我的上帝，
Or conversely, it's written at such a high level that, my God,

1039
00:49:23,139 --> 00:49:25,989
您必须开始查看库的源代码
you have to start looking at the source code of the library

1040
00:49:25,989 --> 00:49:27,669
甚至弄清楚如何使用它。
to even figure out how to use it.

1041
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:29,770
您将看到两个极端。
And you will see both extremes.

1042
00:49:29,769 --> 00:49:33,279
但是，您可以轻松阅读Python文档等内容，
But getting comfortable with reading things like Python's documentation,

1043
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,670
就像某些API文档将帮助您一样，我们希望，
like some API's documentation is just going to empower you, we hope,

1044
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:39,070
更要做些更酷的事情
all the more to just do much cooler things

1045
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:42,910
并最终自行解决更强大的问题。
and solve more powerful problems on your own, ultimately.

1046
00:49:42,909 --> 00:49:46,029
最后，这也许是最大的一个，教你
And then lastly, and this is perhaps the biggest one, teaching you

1047
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:47,860
如何教自己新的语言。
how to teach yourself new languages.

1048
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:51,250
我们没有在Python上花费太多时间是有原因的。
There is a reason we didn't spend that much time on Python.

1049
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:53,680
而且我们在JavaScript上花费的时间更少。
And we spent even less time on JavaScript.

1050
00:49:53,679 --> 00:49:55,839
在SQL上的时间差不多。
And about an equal amount of time on SQL.

1051
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:58,603
我们花了几周时间在C上，不是因为C
We spent a number of weeks on C, not because C

1052
00:49:58,603 --> 00:50:00,520
比任何一种语言都重要，
is more important than any of those languages,

1053
00:50:00,519 --> 00:50:02,739
但是因为一路走来，你们中的很多人
but because along the way, many of you, most of you

1054
00:50:02,739 --> 00:50:04,749
只是在学习编程本身。
were just learning programming itself.

1055
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:08,319
即使随着课程的进行语言发生了变化和发展，
And even as the language has changed and evolved as the course went on,

1056
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,520
想法并没有消失。
the ideas didn't go away.

1057
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:12,399
仍然有函数，条件，循环，甚至
There were still functions, and conditions, and loops, and even

1058
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,550
事件的条款。
events by terms.

1059
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:16,690
再说一遍，所以我们希望您不要参加这样的课程
And, again, so we hope that you walk away from a class like this

1060
00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:19,450
没想到，哦，我学会了用C语言编程。
not thinking that, oh, I learned how to program in C.

1061
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:21,489
或者，哦，我学会了如何用Python编程。
Or oh, I learned how to program in Python.

1062
00:50:21,489 --> 00:50:24,609
因为我们还没有人是这些方面的专家。
Because none of us have been experts at those things yet.

1063
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:28,390
但是您现在肯定会变得更加熟练，只是成为一名程序员
But you certainly are now more expert at just being a programmer

1064
00:50:28,389 --> 00:50:31,359
找出需要填补哪些知识的漏洞，什么
and figuring out what holes you need to fill in in your knowledge, what

1065
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,740
您需要填补空白才能弄清楚，
gaps you need to fill in order to figure out,

1066
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:36,879
哦，这种语言中相同方法的语法是什么
oh, what is the syntax for this same approach in this language

1067
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,738
正如我已经在另一个地方看到的那样。
as I've already seen in another.

1068
00:50:38,737 --> 00:50:41,529
这就是为什么我们比较了许多这样的语言的原因
And that's, indeed, why we compared so many of these languages side

1069
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:45,640
并肩而立，只是强调想法没有什么不同，甚至
by side to just reinforce that the ideas are no different, even

1070
00:50:45,639 --> 00:50:49,796
尽管语法需要使用大量Google搜索，也需要大量询问。
though the syntax is going to require a bunch of Googling, a bunch of asking.

1071
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:52,630
这也是我们希望您能够自己做的事情
And that, too, is something we hope you'll be able to do on your own

1072
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:56,832
在这些语言之后，下一件事就是最好的事情。
as the next and best thing comes along well after these languages.

1073
00:50:56,831 --> 00:50:58,539
好吧，说到训练轮，你就是
Well, speaking of training wheels, you're

1074
00:50:58,539 --> 00:51:02,409
欢迎并鼓励您在最终项目中继续使用CS50 IDE。
welcome and encouraged to keep using CS50 IDE for your final project.

1075
00:51:02,409 --> 00:51:05,509
而且，您甚至可以将其用于其他课程或项目。
And heck, you can use it even after that for other courses or projects.

1076
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:08,260
但归根结底，这也可能是一个训练轮
But at the end of the day, this, too, is probably a training wheel

1077
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:10,360
你应该自己起飞。
that you should take off for yourself.

1078
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:14,720
IDE旨在代表现实世界中的编程
The IDE is designed to be representative of a real world programming

1079
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:15,219
环境。
environment.

1080
00:51:15,219 --> 00:51:17,619
但是我们绝对为您做了很多事情。
But we definitely did a lot of things for you.

1081
00:51:17,619 --> 00:51:20,391
我们安装了您可能需要的所有库
We installed all the libraries you might need over

1082
00:51:20,391 --> 00:51:21,849
本学期的课程。
the course of the semester for you.

1083
00:51:21,849 --> 00:51:24,579
我们有这些漂亮的命令以数字50结尾。
We've got these nice commands that end in the number 50.

1084
00:51:24,579 --> 00:51:27,677
当您从事第一份工作时，那些往往不存在于现实世界中，
Those don't tend to exist in the real world when you're at your first job,

1085
00:51:27,677 --> 00:51:29,469
或者你要回到自己的部门
or you're going back to your own department

1086
00:51:29,469 --> 00:51:31,209
解决代码中的一些问题
and solving some problem in code, there's

1087
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:32,937
不会成为长期的help50。
not going to be a help50 longer term.

1088
00:51:32,936 --> 00:51:35,769
因此，我们认为我们也将花费几分钟
And so what we thought we would do, too, is spend just a few minutes

1089
00:51:35,769 --> 00:51:38,889
让您大致了解一些行业标准
giving you a sense of what are some of the more industry standard

1090
00:51:38,889 --> 00:51:42,009
您应该考虑使用，玩耍的工具
tools that you should consider using, playing with, perhaps

1091
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:45,820
过度休息或在接下来的几个月里，以便您确切地知道该怎么做
over break or in the months to come, so that you know exactly how to do

1092
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:48,880
与本学期一样，但在您自己的Mac上
the same kinds of things you did this term, but on your own Mac

1093
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,380
或PC或其他设备。
or PC or some other device.

1094
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:55,870
因此，例如，如果您想安装一组命令行工具
So for instance, if you would like to install a set of command line tools

1095
00:51:55,869 --> 00:51:59,199
在Mac或PC上，事实证明其中有些已经存在。
on your Mac or PC, turns out some of them are already there.

1096
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:01,509
确实，我曾经提到Mac OS
Indeed, I mentioned at one point that Mac OS

1097
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:05,170
在其应用程序文件夹实用程序的终端下有一个终端窗口。
has under its applications folder utility's terminal a terminal window.

1098
00:52:05,170 --> 00:52:07,180
Windows也有类似的东西。
And Windows has an analog as well.

1099
00:52:07,179 --> 00:52:10,809
但是Mac或PC不一定附带其他命令，
But there's other commands that don't necessarily come with your Mac or PC,

1100
00:52:10,809 --> 00:52:13,899
例如，用于C或其他工具的编译器。
for instance, a compiler for C or some other tools.

1101
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:17,650
因此，我们鼓励您在Mac或PC上访问此类网址，
And so we would encourage you to visit URLs like these on your Mac or PC,

1102
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:21,490
分别，如果您只想安装更多的命令行工具
respectively, if you'd like to just install more of the command line tools

1103
00:52:21,489 --> 00:52:26,119
您在自己的环境中在CS50中看到和使用的内容。
that you saw and used in CS50 in your own environment.

1104
00:52:26,119 --> 00:52:29,379
我们建议您阅读另一种工具，在这种情况下，请继续阅读
Another tool we would recommend that you read up on, or in this case

1105
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:31,650
观看，布莱恩（Brian）的视频是吉特（Git）。
watch, a video by Brian, is Git.

1106
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:35,410
Git是版本控制的一个示例，它是基础构建
Git is an example of version control, a fundamental building

1107
00:52:35,409 --> 00:52:38,649
这些天来，任何好的软件实践都无法实现。
block of any good software practice these days.

1108
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:42,460
我们在CS50中使用了Git，但是我们向您隐藏了此细节。
We kind of use Git in CS50, but we hide this detail from you.

1109
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:46,465
每当您运行check50或Submit50时，我们都会在后台进行检查，
Any time you have run check50 or submit50, we underneath the hood,

1110
00:52:46,465 --> 00:52:51,230
一直在运行一个名为Git的开源命令，该命令会推送您的代码，
have been running an open source command called Git, which pushes your code,

1111
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:54,550
在这种情况下，从CS50 IDE到GitHub.com，这仅仅是一个
in this case from CS50 IDE to GitHub.com, which is just one

1112
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:56,980
几个热门网站中，您可以通过
of several popular websites via which you

1113
00:52:56,980 --> 00:53:00,400
可以托管代码，共享代码，在代码上进行协作，运行自动化测试，
can host code, share code, collaborate on code, run automated tests,

1114
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,220
等等。
and the like.

1115
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:05,019
但是Git本身可以用来终止约定
But Git itself can be used to put an end to the convention

1116
00:53:05,019 --> 00:53:08,472
即使是Microsoft Word或Google Docs之类的东西，您也可能拥有
that you probably have, even with things like Microsoft Word or Google Docs,

1117
00:53:08,472 --> 00:53:11,139
当您想保存某些内容或文件的另一个副本时，
where when you want to save something or another copy of a file,

1118
00:53:11,139 --> 00:53:14,019
也许您只是将文件名的末尾更改为2，
maybe you just changed the end of the file name to 2,

1119
00:53:14,019 --> 00:53:16,719
然后下一次到3或4。
and then the next time to 3, or to 4.

1120
00:53:16,719 --> 00:53:19,567
或者，也许您在星期日晚上破折号，在星期一早晨破折号。
Or maybe you do dash Sunday night, dash Monday morning.

1121
00:53:19,568 --> 00:53:21,610
我的意思是，有时我仍然为此感到内gui
I mean, I'm still guilty of this sometimes when I

1122
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:22,960
想要对我的文件进行版本控制。
want to version my files.

1123
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,770
有更好的方法可以做到这一点。
There are better ways to do that.

1124
00:53:24,769 --> 00:53:26,769
因此，如果您将来发现自己，
And so if you find yourself in the future,

1125
00:53:26,769 --> 00:53:29,649
做一些您认为必须有更好方法的事情，
doing something that you think there's got to be a better way,

1126
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:33,007
Git是这些更好方法之一的示例。
Git is an example of one of those better ways.

1127
00:53:33,007 --> 00:53:34,840
如果您观看此特定视频，请阅读
And if you watch this particular video, read

1128
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:38,950
从本质上讲，它不仅可以帮助您维护多个版本，
up a bit more, it will help you not only maintain multiple versions, in essence,

1129
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:42,009
您自己的代码的备份，它最终还将使您有能力
backups of your own code, it will also empower you ultimately

1130
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:44,230
与他人合作。
to collaborate with others.

1131
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:46,390
至于文字编辑器，您可能会使用的工具
As for text editors, the tool that you might

1132
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:50,224
用于实际编写代码，也许是最新，最出色和最先进的代码之一
use to actually write code, perhaps one of the latest and greatest and most

1133
00:53:50,224 --> 00:53:52,599
这些天流行的是称为VS Code的东西。
popular out there these days is something called VS Code.

1134
00:53:52,599 --> 00:53:56,259
这是一个开放源代码工具，您可以在自己的Mac和PC上下载。
This is an open source tool that you can download on your own Mac and PCs.

1135
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:58,840
它也越来越多地在网络上可用。
Increasingly, it's available on the web as well.

1136
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:02,170
但这无疑是当今最受欢迎的工具之一。
But this is one of the most popular tools, certainly, out there today.

1137
00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:03,410
但这只是一个文本编辑器。
But it's just a text editor.

1138
00:54:03,409 --> 00:54:06,699
这些工具中的每一个都有绝对的替代品
And there are absolutely alternatives to each and every one of these tools

1139
00:54:06,699 --> 00:54:09,351
当然也欢迎您来看看。
that you're certainly welcome to take a look at as well.

1140
00:54:09,351 --> 00:54:11,559
好吧，如果您对事物的网络方面感兴趣，
Well, if you're interested in the web side of things,

1141
00:54:11,559 --> 00:54:14,199
而您想要托管一个网站（例如静态网站），
and you want to host a website, like a static website, just

1142
00:54:14,199 --> 00:54:17,559
您自己的个人主页，GitHub页面就是一回事。
your own personal homepage, GitHub pages is a thing.

1143
00:54:17,559 --> 00:54:18,699
Netlify是一回事。
Netlify is a thing.

1144
00:54:18,699 --> 00:54:21,799
还有点点点滴滴，还有很多其他的虚拟主机，
And dot dot dot, there are so many other web hosts out there,

1145
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,640
其中许多提供免费或学生级别
many of which offer free or student level

1146
00:54:24,639 --> 00:54:28,239
帐户，这样他们就不必花费任何费用。
accounts so that they don't necessarily need to even cost anything.

1147
00:54:28,239 --> 00:54:30,009
但是静态不同于动态。
But static is different from dynamic.

1148
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:33,370
而且，如果您实际上想托管一个实际需要使用的Web应用程序，
And if you actually want to host a web application that actually takes

1149
00:54:33,369 --> 00:54:35,559
用户输入，将内容存储在数据库中，执行
user input, stores things in a database, does

1150
00:54:35,559 --> 00:54:37,649
比静态网站更有趣的事情，
more interesting things than a static website,

1151
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:40,150
您可能想使用一种叫做Heroku的东西，
you might want to use something called Heroku, which is just

1152
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:43,930
受欢迎的第三方服务，其中也包含您免费的入门级帐户
a popular third party service that also has a free entry level account that you

1153
00:54:43,929 --> 00:54:46,029
可以用来开始玩，很常用
can use to start playing with, quite commonly used

1154
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:47,560
由学生进行最终项目。
by students for final projects.

1155
00:54:47,559 --> 00:54:50,629
然后还有其他提供商，更大的云提供商，
And then there's other providers out there, bigger cloud providers,

1156
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:52,888
可以这么说，例如亚马逊，微软和谷歌，
so to speak, like Amazon, and Microsoft, and Google,

1157
00:54:52,887 --> 00:54:55,179
为此，学习曲线可能会更高一些。
for which the learning curve's perhaps a little higher.

1158
00:54:55,179 --> 00:54:58,539
但是它们通常在提供折扣方面也非常好
But they, too, are really good typically about providing discounts

1159
00:54:58,539 --> 00:55:01,689
或免费帐户供学生使用。
or free accounts for student uses as well.

1160
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:04,180
如何与技术主题保持同步。
How to stay abreast of topics in technology.

1161
00:55:04,179 --> 00:55:07,179
当然，我们将重点放在此类基础知识上。
We focus, of course, in a class like this really on fundamentals.

1162
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:10,599
但是您将无法以任何形式获取新闻
But you're not going to be able to pick up the news in any form down the road

1163
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:12,789
却看不到与技术有关的东西。
and not see something that's technology related.

1164
00:55:12,789 --> 00:55:15,849
而且，如果您只是想让自己紧跟事物的脉搏
And if you'd just like to keep your fingers on the pulse of things

1165
00:55:15,849 --> 00:55:18,939
在更广泛的科技世界中，这里只有几个地方
in the tech world more generally, here's just a few places

1166
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:21,010
您可能会喜欢与之并驾齐驱。
that you might enjoy staying abreast of.

1167
00:55:21,010 --> 00:55:24,285
因此，Reddit有几个不同的社区，即subreddit，特别是
So Reddit has a couple of different communities, or subreddit, specifically

1168
00:55:24,284 --> 00:55:26,409
关于编程的内容，都适合有经验的程序员
about programming, both for experienced programmers

1169
00:55:26,409 --> 00:55:28,034
和我们中那些仍在学习中的人。
and those of us who are still learning.

1170
00:55:28,034 --> 00:55:29,784
当然，堆栈溢出
Stack Overflow, of course, you've probably

1171
00:55:29,784 --> 00:55:32,379
在过去的学期中用于解决小问题。
used to solve small problems over the course of the past term.

1172
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:34,610
服务器故障在本质上与此类似，
Server Fault is similar in spirit to that,

1173
00:55:34,610 --> 00:55:38,770
但它更侧重于管理以及Linux类型的内容。
but it's focused more on administration, Linux-type stuff as well.

1174
00:55:38,769 --> 00:55:41,717
Techcrunch是一个受欢迎的地方，不仅是面向消费者的新闻，
Techcrunch is a popular place, not just for consumer-focused news,

1175
00:55:41,717 --> 00:55:43,759
但实际上，任何技术趋势都在发展。
but just really anything that's trending in tech.

1176
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,650
然后在YCombinator的网站上建立了一个名为Hacker News的网站
And then a website called Hacker News on YCombinator's site

1177
00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:49,982
那也是偶尔看一眼的地方
that also is a place to just glance at once in a while

1178
00:55:49,981 --> 00:55:52,689
因为您会看到最新和最好的库或其他内容
because you'll see the latest and greatest libraries or something

1179
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:53,770
那是新生的。
that's quite nascent.

1180
00:55:53,769 --> 00:55:56,229
因此，如果总的来说，您只是想了解新功能
So if in general you just want to get a sense of what's new

1181
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:58,150
以及科技界的趋势，事物
and what's trending out there in the tech world, things

1182
00:55:58,150 --> 00:56:00,442
即使你不在乎也应该意识到
that you should just be aware of even if you don't care

1183
00:56:00,442 --> 00:56:02,860
进入那些做这些事情的杂草，
to get into the weeds of doing those things hands on,

1184
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:06,740
这些都是不错的网站，肯定还有其他网站。
these are all good sites and surely others out there as well.

1185
00:56:06,739 --> 00:56:10,179
然后，CS50当然拥有自己的在线社区，其中一些
And then, CS50, of course, has its own online community, some of which

1186
00:56:10,179 --> 00:56:13,419
你们中的一些人在高中甚至更早之前就已经参加了一段时间。
some of you have been part for some time, in high school or even prior.

1187
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:15,700
请随时与我们保持联系，
Please feel free to keep in touch with us in some way,

1188
00:56:15,699 --> 00:56:17,949
或还一些东西给你的继任者
or give back a little something to your successors who

1189
00:56:17,949 --> 00:56:20,139
可能会沿着这条路线或其他路线走
might take this or another course down the road

1190
00:56:20,139 --> 00:56:23,289
并不仅在这里参与这些社区的提问，
and participate not only in asking questions in these communities here,

1191
00:56:23,289 --> 00:56:27,469
而且还要回答别人的问题。
but also in answering others' questions as well.

1192
00:56:27,469 --> 00:56:30,099
所以我们认为我们会少做一些讨论
So we thought we would do a little less of the talking

1193
00:56:30,099 --> 00:56:34,789
现在，一起扭转局面，共同进行最终的社区活动。
now and turn things around for a sort of final community activity together.

1194
00:56:34,789 --> 00:56:37,319
感谢许多提出问题的人
Thanks to many of you who have contributed questions

1195
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:38,570
在过去的几周中。
over the past couple of weeks.

1196
00:56:38,570 --> 00:56:41,950
多亏了Brian，我们认为我们可以一起举办CS50测验节目
Thanks to Brian, we thought we'd put together a CS50 quiz show

1197
00:56:41,949 --> 00:56:43,959
在此结束最后的演讲。
on which to end this final lecture.

1198
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:47,200
这些是您，员工，Brian提出的问题。
These are questions written by you, by the staff, by Brian.

1199
00:56:47,199 --> 00:56:49,899
这将是每个人嗡嗡作响的机会
And it'll be an opportunity for everyone to buzz in

1200
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:54,250
他们对我们预先准备的大约20个问题的回答。
with their answers to some 20 questions that we have prepared in advance.

1201
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:55,639
时间就是生命。
Time is of the essence.

1202
00:56:55,639 --> 00:56:59,059
因此，如果您加快蜂鸣速度，您的分数将会更高。
So your score will be higher if you buzz in more quickly.

1203
00:56:59,059 --> 00:57:01,149
因此，重要的是不仅要正确，
So it's important not only to be correct,

1204
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:04,820
而且对于这个特定对象也要快速。
but also to be fast for this particular one as well.

1205
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:08,060
稍后，我将继续分享我的屏幕。
And in just a moment, I'm going to go ahead and share my screen.

1206
00:57:08,059 --> 00:57:12,249
再说一次，我们这里有大约20个问题，所有问题都来自于
And, again, we'll have some 20 questions here, all of them drawn from,

1207
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:14,529
受CS50启发的某种形式。
inspired by CS50 in some form.

1208
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:18,640
在每个问题之后，根据有多少人是对是错，
And after each question, depending on how many people get it right or wrong,

1209
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:21,969
我们将花一点时间至少说明它在哪里正确
we'll take a moment to at least explain where it is you went right

1210
00:57:21,969 --> 00:57:23,919
还是在哪里你错了。
or where it is you went wrong.

1211
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:24,700
好吧，布莱恩。
All right, Brian.

1212
00:57:24,699 --> 00:57:26,171
准备好了吗？
Ready on your end?

1213
00:57:26,172 --> 00:57:27,380
布莱恩·于：我们已经准备好出发了。
BRIAN YU: We are ready to go.

1214
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:29,880
大卫·马兰（David MALAN）：好吧，让我们继续看一下
DAVID MALAN: All right, well, let's go ahead and take a look

1215
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,150
这里有第一个问题。
with the first question here.

1216
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:35,860
将源代码编译为机器代码的步骤是什么？
What are the steps for compiling source code into machine code?

1217
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:38,290
预处理，编译，组装和链接？
Preprocessing, compiling, assembling, and linking?

1218
00:57:38,289 --> 00:57:40,809
编写，编译，调试和测试？
Writing, compiling, debugging, and testing?

1219
00:57:40,809 --> 00:57:43,269
处理，创建，声明和叮当声？
Processing, creating, asserting, and clang?

1220
00:57:43,269 --> 00:57:45,409
还是赚？
Or make?

1221
00:57:45,409 --> 00:57:49,309
继续并在手机，笔记本电脑或台式机上嗡嗡作响，
Go ahead and buzz in on your phone or laptop or desktop,

1222
00:57:49,309 --> 00:57:51,499
使用与Brian提供的网址相同的网址。
using that same URL that Brian provided.

1223
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:55,040
每个问题您有20秒的时间，现在剩下两个。
You've got 20 seconds for each question, two of which now remain.

1224
00:57:55,039 --> 00:57:55,969
时间到了。
That's it for time.

1225
00:57:55,969 --> 00:57:58,094
让我们继续来看一下这里的结果。
Let's go ahead and take a look at the results here.

1226
00:57:58,094 --> 00:58:01,999
你们当中有70％的人说要进行预处理，编译，组装，
It looks like 70% of you said preprocessing, compiling, assembling,

1227
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:02,750
和链接。
and linking.

1228
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:04,987
布莱恩，您想告诉我们是否正确吗？
Brian, would you like to tell us if that's right?

1229
00:58:04,987 --> 00:58:05,570
布莱恩·于：是的。
BRIAN YU: Yes.

1230
00:58:05,570 --> 00:58:06,800
这是正确的答案。
That is the correct answer.

1231
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:10,010
首先进行预处理，然后进行编译，组装和链接
Preprocessing first, compiling, assembling, and linking, all of that

1232
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:11,440
在幕后。
is behind the scenes.

1233
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,940
因此，您不必每次编译时都考虑。
So you don't necessarily think about every time you compile.

1234
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:15,590
但这确实是步骤。
But those are, indeed, the steps.

1235
00:58:15,590 --> 00:58:18,245
DAVID MALAN：公平地说，make可以说是一种抽象
DAVID MALAN: And to be fair, make is arguably an abstraction

1236
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:20,869
因为这只是整个过程的开始。
for all of that insofar as it just kicks off the whole process.

1237
00:58:20,869 --> 00:58:24,169
但我认为，更准确地说，步骤的答案是，
But I think a little more precisely, an answer to steps would be,

1238
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:25,543
确实，那四件事在那里。
indeed, those four things there.

1239
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:27,710
好吧，让我们在这里看一下计分板。
All right, let's take a look at the scoreboard here.

1240
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:29,418
我们有大量的来宾帐户。
We have a whole number of guest accounts.

1241
00:58:29,418 --> 00:58:33,500
第200位来宾处于领先地位，但在此与其他几位客人并列。
Guest number 200 is in the lead, but tied with several other guests here.

1242
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:36,240
因此，那些拥有1,000分的人很快就会嗡嗡作响。
So those of you with 1,000 points buzzed in really quickly.

1243
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:37,909
因此，时间再次至关重要。
So again time is of the essence.

1244
00:58:37,909 --> 00:58:42,559
下一个问题，二进制搜索的运行时间是多少？
Next question, what is the runtime of binary search?

1245
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:47,329
它是1的O，log n的O，n的O，还是n的O的平方？
Is it O of 1, O of log n, O of n, or O of n squared?

1246
00:58:47,329 --> 00:58:52,699
剩下15秒，即二进制搜索的运行时间。
15 seconds remain, the runtime of binary search.

1247
00:58:52,699 --> 00:58:55,279
回想一下，这是我们研究的首批算法之一。
Recall, this was one of the first algorithms we looked at.

1248
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,350
它最初带有电话簿，
It was first incarnated with a phone book,

1249
00:58:57,349 --> 00:59:00,499
即使我们并没有在很早以前就用这个名字来称呼它。
even if we didn't call it that by name early on.

1250
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,779
布莱恩，让我们看一下结果。
Brian, let's take a look at the results.

1251
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:05,690
看起来有61％的人说登录n。
Looks like 61% of you say log n.

1252
00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:06,840
布莱恩？
Brian?

1253
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:08,670
布莱恩·于：答案n是正确的答案。
BRIAN YU: Log n is the correct answer.

1254
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:10,040
如果您还记得那本电话簿，问题是
If you remember that phone book, the question

1255
00:59:10,039 --> 00:59:11,899
真的可以归结为多少次
really came down to how many times can we

1256
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:13,940
一次又一次地将电话簿分开
divide that phone book and half again and again

1257
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:16,590
一次又一次，直到我们只讨论一页。
and again, until we get down to just one page.

1258
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:20,120
如果电话簿中有三页是n页，那么结果就是n的日志。
And that turns out to be log of n if three are n pages in the phone book.

1259
00:59:20,119 --> 00:59:23,239
大卫·马兰（David MALAN）：的确，随时随地都有一些技巧在向前发展
DAVID MALAN: Indeed, and sort of pro tip moving forward in life, any time

1260
00:59:23,239 --> 00:59:26,149
您会看到一半又一半又一半发生了一些事情，
you see something happening in half and half and half and half,

1261
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:28,670
很有可能会涉及一种算法
odds are there's going to be an algorithm involved

1262
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:31,070
在其分析中的某处。
somewhere in the analysis thereof.

1263
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:34,710
好吧，这里的下一个排行榜，来宾200略有下降。
All right, next leaderboard here, guest 200 slipped down a little bit.

1264
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:39,200
但是现在我们有一大堆人以2,000分排在第一位。
But we have a whole bunch of people tied in first place for 2,000 points now.

1265
00:59:39,199 --> 00:59:42,499
下一个问题，其中哪些动物是第一个
Next question, which of these animals was the first

1266
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:45,620
在CS50讲座中提到？
to be mentioned in a CS50 lecture?

1267
00:59:45,619 --> 00:59:50,249
骆驼，蟒蛇，鸭，猫。
Llama, python, duck, cat.

1268
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:52,750
剩下15秒。
15 seconds remain.

1269
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:57,929
CS50讲座中首先提到的是哪个？
Which was mentioned first in a CS50 lecture?

1270
00:59:57,929 --> 00:59:59,909
让我们看看结果。
And let's see the results.

1271
00:59:59,909 --> 01:00:04,499
看起来猫只勉强接受了51％的鸭子。
Looks like cat just barely eked out duck with 51%.

1272
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:05,177
布莱恩？
Brian?

1273
01:00:05,177 --> 01:00:07,260
布莱恩·于：实际上，猫是正确的答案。
BRIAN YU: And cat is, in fact, the correct answer.

1274
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:10,520
骆驼出现在实验室1中，但在讲课中没有提及。
Llamas showed up in Lab 1, but they were not mentioned in lecture.

1275
01:00:10,519 --> 01:00:12,269
鸭子直到一点点才露面
The duck didn't show up until a little bit

1276
01:00:12,269 --> 01:00:13,889
稍后当我们谈论调试时。
later when we talked about debugging.

1277
01:00:13,889 --> 01:00:17,279
在讲座的最后简短地提到了Python。
And Python was briefly mentioned at the end of the lecture.

1278
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,590
但这是在我们向Scratch介绍自己之后。
But it was after we introduced ourselves to Scratch.

1279
01:00:19,590 --> 01:00:22,350
而且，Scratch的主要角色当然是猫。
And the main character in Scratch is, of course, the cat.

1280
01:00:22,349 --> 01:00:25,599
大卫·马兰（David MALAN）：好的，我们可能很快就会在这里看到一些传播。
DAVID MALAN: All right, we're probably going to see a bit of spread here soon.

1281
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:27,851
但是，我们有一整群人有3,000。
We have a whole bunch of people with 3,000, though.

1282
01:00:27,851 --> 01:00:29,309
但是名称开始有所不同。
But the names are starting to vary.

1283
01:00:29,309 --> 01:00:30,989
让我们继续下一个问题。
Let's move on to the next question.

1284
01:00:30,989 --> 01:00:34,919
每次分配内存时，还必须确保-
Every time you malloc memory, you must also be sure to--

1285
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:39,690
重新分配，返回，释放还是退出？
realloc, return, free, or exit?

1286
01:00:39,690 --> 01:00:44,310
每次分配内存时，还应确保重新分配内存，
Every time you malloc memory, you should also be sure to realloc,

1287
01:00:44,309 --> 01:00:48,269
返回，免费还是退出？
return, free, or exit?

1288
01:00:48,269 --> 01:00:51,419
回想一下，malloc是许多分段错误的根源
Recall that malloc was the source of a lot of segmentation faults

1289
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:52,230
学期中。
mid-semester.

1290
01:00:52,230 --> 01:00:55,950
现在有78％的受访者表示免费。
The responses now are 78% said free.

1291
01:00:55,949 --> 01:00:57,041
布莱恩，你同意吗？
Brian, do you concur?

1292
01:00:57,041 --> 01:00:58,499
布莱恩·于：他们都是正确的。
BRIAN YU: And they are all correct.

1293
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:01,541
每当您分配内存时，请动态地向计算机请求一些内存。
Whenever you malloc memory, ask the computer for some memory dynamically.

1294
01:01:01,541 --> 01:01:04,249
完成后，应将其还给计算机
When you're done with it, you should give it back to the computer

1295
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:05,010
通过免费拨打。
by calling free.

1296
01:01:05,010 --> 01:01:06,927
大卫·马兰（David MALAN）：确实，还有布莱恩（Brian），
DAVID MALAN: Indeed, and Brian, as a teachable

1297
01:01:06,927 --> 01:01:10,140
那一刻，为什么我们从来没有免费拨打过电话的got_string，我们现在
moment, why is it that we never had a call free forget_string, which we now

1298
01:01:10,139 --> 01:01:12,089
知道引擎盖下面正在使用某种东西
know underneath the hood is using something

1299
01:01:12,090 --> 01:01:14,070
像malloc分配内存？
like malloc to allocate memory?

1300
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:16,500
布莱恩·于：所以get_string是CS50库中的一个函数。
BRIAN YU: So get_string was a function in CS50's library.

1301
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:19,890
CS50的库将为您处理该内存管理过程。
And CS50's library takes care of that memory management process for you.

1302
01:01:19,889 --> 01:01:23,069
因此，您不必担心自己释放所有这些内存。
So you didn't have to worry about freeing all of that memory yourself.

1303
01:01:23,070 --> 01:01:26,250
DAVID MALAN：的确如此，但是任何时候调用malloc都必须免费。
DAVID MALAN: Indeed, but anytime you call malloc, you must call free.

1304
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:28,439
好吧，这里的排行榜看起来像我们
All right, the leaderboard here looks like we have

1305
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:30,840
来宾600仍然领先4,000。
guest 600 still in the lead with 4,000.

1306
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:31,860
下一个问题。
Next question.

1307
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:34,550
什么是比赛条件？
What is a race condition?

1308
01:01:34,550 --> 01:01:37,040
什么时候适合赛车比赛？
When conditions are nice out for racing?

1309
01:01:37,039 --> 01:01:40,669
当两件事同时发生并产生意想不到的结果时？
When two things happen at the same time and produce an unexpected result?

1310
01:01:40,670 --> 01:01:43,170
当一行代码执行得太快时？
When a line of code is executed too quickly?

1311
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:45,830
当一行代码执行得太慢时？
When a line of code is executed too slowly?

1312
01:01:45,829 --> 01:01:49,129
什么是比赛条件？
What is a race condition?

1313
01:01:49,130 --> 01:01:50,850
啊，事情很快就升级了。
Ah, things just escalated quickly.

1314
01:01:50,849 --> 01:01:54,589
但是您会记得这是在SQL上下文中出现的。
But you'll recall this came up in the context of SQL.

1315
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:57,020
和数据库，0秒，让我们看看。
And databases, 0 seconds, let's see.

1316
01:01:57,019 --> 01:02:00,169
85％的人说同时发生两件事
85% said when two things happen at the same time

1317
01:02:00,170 --> 01:02:02,138
并产生意想不到的结果。布莱恩？
and produce an unexpected result. Brian?

1318
01:02:02,137 --> 01:02:03,679
布莱恩·于：这是正确的答案。
BRIAN YU: That is the correct answer.

1319
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:06,649
我赞赏至少有1％的人说，如果外面有条件
I appreciate that at least 1% of people said when conditions outside

1320
01:02:06,650 --> 01:02:07,640
非常适合赛车。
are nice for racing.

1321
01:02:07,639 --> 01:02:10,077
但是至少在计算机科学的背景下，
But in the context of computer science, at least,

1322
01:02:10,077 --> 01:02:13,369
当两件事同时发生并且可能产生意想不到的结果时，
when two things happen at the same time and could produce an unexpected result,

1323
01:02:13,369 --> 01:02:15,679
这就是我们所说的竞赛条件。
that is what we would refer to as a race condition.

1324
01:02:15,679 --> 01:02:17,329
大卫·马兰（David MALAN）：的确，回想起我和布莱恩的结局
DAVID MALAN: Indeed, recall that's how Brian and I ended up

1325
01:02:17,329 --> 01:02:18,972
冰箱里有太多牛奶。
with too much milk in the refrigerator.

1326
01:02:18,972 --> 01:02:21,139
因为我们都检查了该变量的状态
Because we both inspected the state of that variable

1327
01:02:21,139 --> 01:02:22,954
基本上是在同一时间。
at essentially the same time.

1328
01:02:22,954 --> 01:02:24,329
好吧，这里的排行榜。
All right, the leader board here.

1329
01:02:24,329 --> 01:02:26,629
现在，我们有一大群人获得了5,000分。
Now we have a whole bunch of people with 5,000 points.

1330
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:27,590
让我们继续。
Let's move on.

1331
01:02:27,590 --> 01:02:32,660
放大照片是否可以增强照片以产生更多细节？
Does zooming in on a photo let you enhance it to generate more detail?

1332
01:02:32,659 --> 01:02:35,209
是的，就像CSI中一样。
Yes, just like in CSI.

1333
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:39,370
不，一张照片只有一定数量的细节。
No, a photo only has a certain amount of detail.

1334
01:02:39,369 --> 01:02:45,119
放大照片是否可以增强照片以产生更多细节？
Does zooming in on a photo let you enhance it to generate more detail?

1335
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:48,389
我会承认，我最近在看一些节目并想到了你
And I will admit, I was watching some show recently and thought of you

1336
01:02:48,389 --> 01:02:50,339
当他们从字面上说时，一切都会增强。
all when they literally said, enhance.

1337
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:52,490
好的，0秒。
All right, 0 seconds.

1338
01:02:52,489 --> 01:02:56,969
似乎有93％的人说过，不，一张照片只有一定数量的细节。
Looks like 93% of you said, no, a photo only has a certain amount of detail.

1339
01:02:56,969 --> 01:02:59,009
你们中有7％的人说是，就像在CSI中一样。
7% of you said yes, just like in CSI.

1340
01:02:59,010 --> 01:03:01,290
布莱恩，您能帮助我们调和两者吗？
Brian, can you help us reconcile the two?

1341
01:03:01,289 --> 01:03:03,479
布莱恩·于：在这种情况下，93％是正确的。
BRIAN YU: The 93%, in this case, are correct.

1342
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,800
一张照片只有一定数量的像素。
A photo only has a certain number of pixels.

1343
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:08,100
如果您继续放大一个像素，
And if you keep zooming in on one pixel, you're

1344
01:03:08,099 --> 01:03:10,469
无法产生更多的细节，
not going to be able to generate additional detail that

1345
01:03:10,469 --> 01:03:11,527
以前不在那里。
wasn't there before.

1346
01:03:11,527 --> 01:03:14,069
戴维·马兰（David MALAN）：公平地说，这是一种变化。
DAVID MALAN: And to be fair, that's kind of sort of changing.

1347
01:03:14,070 --> 01:03:15,840
或者至少答案现在变得越来越难了
Or at least the answer is getting a little harder nowadays

1348
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:18,450
借助机器学习或人工智能，
with machine learning or artificial intelligence,

1349
01:03:18,449 --> 01:03:21,209
算法在哪里弄清楚什么级别的细节
where algorithms sort of figure out what level of detail

1350
01:03:21,210 --> 01:03:22,750
可能或应该在那里。
could or should be there.

1351
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:24,810
但这实际上只是统计推断，
But that really is just statistical inference,

1352
01:03:24,809 --> 01:03:27,809
实际上并没有恢复曾经存储的信息
that is not actually recovering information that was ever stored

1353
01:03:27,809 --> 01:03:29,819
在相机或其他设备上。
on the camera or some other device.

1354
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:34,290
好吧，现在排行榜的得分是6,000分，这些人并列。
All right, the leaderboard now is at 6,000 points with these folks tied.

1355
01:03:34,289 --> 01:03:38,669
以下哪一项不是好的哈希函数的特征？
Which of the following is not a characteristic of a good hash function?

1356
01:03:38,670 --> 01:03:44,280
确定性输出，随机性，均匀分布，效率。
Deterministic output, randomness, uniform distribution, efficiency.

1357
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:45,780
事情再次变得真实。
Things just got real again.

1358
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:50,160
以下哪一项不是好的哈希函数的特征？
Which of the following is not a characteristic of a good hash function?

1359
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:54,599
回想一下我们在哈希表的上下文中使用了哈希函数
Recall we used hash functions in the context of hash tables

1360
01:03:54,599 --> 01:03:57,069
在谈论数据结构时。
when talking about data structures.

1361
01:03:57,070 --> 01:03:57,570
好的？
All right?

1362
01:03:57,570 --> 01:03:58,770
一秒。
One second.

1363
01:03:58,769 --> 01:04:00,929
这次的答案更加广泛。
The answers are more spread this time.

1364
01:04:00,929 --> 01:04:03,269
62％的人不喜欢随机性。
62% don't like randomness.

1365
01:04:03,269 --> 01:04:04,171
布赖恩，应该吗？
Brian, should they?

1366
01:04:04,172 --> 01:04:05,880
布莱恩·于：那是正确的答案。
BRIAN YU: And that is the correct answer.

1367
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,670
随机性不是良好哈希函数的特征。
Randomness is not a characteristic of a good hash function.

1368
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:10,650
您希望您的哈希函数始终为您提供
You want your hash function to always give you

1369
01:04:10,650 --> 01:04:12,330
相同的输出给出相同的输入。
the same output given the same input.

1370
01:04:12,329 --> 01:04:15,149
这样，您可以依靠它的输出结果。
That way you can rely on whatever the output of it is.

1371
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:17,290
如果是随机的，将很难使用。
If it's random, it's going to be hard to use.

1372
01:04:17,289 --> 01:04:19,122
大卫·马兰（David MALAN）：确实，请考虑使用拼写检查器
DAVID MALAN: Indeed, consider a spellchecker

1373
01:04:19,123 --> 01:04:20,550
随机说是或否。
that randomly says yes or no.

1374
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:23,250
这是一个词，可能不是您想要的属性。
This is a word, probably not a property you want.

1375
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:26,430
好吧，现在排行榜，我们正在努力达到7,000点，
All right, the leaderboard now, we're eking our way up to 7,000 points,

1376
01:04:26,429 --> 01:04:28,589
但终于开始看到一些传播。
but finally starting to see some spread.

1377
01:04:28,590 --> 01:04:31,260
因此，你们中的一些人还不够快或不够正确。
So a few of you haven't been quite quick or correct enough.

1378
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:34,140
下一个问题，FIFO代表什么？
Next question, what does FIFO stand for?

1379
01:04:34,139 --> 01:04:35,549
先进先出
FIFO.

1380
01:04:35,550 --> 01:04:40,620
它是普通狗的名字吗，您的信用评分，先进先出，
Is it a common dog's name, your credit score, first in, first out,

1381
01:04:40,619 --> 01:04:43,579
功能输入，文件输出？
function input, file output?

1382
01:04:43,579 --> 01:04:46,699
FIFO代表什么？
What does FIFO stand for?

1383
01:04:46,699 --> 01:04:49,219
我会很好奇看到这里的蔓延。
I'll be curious to see the spread here.

1384
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:50,329
让我们来看看。
Let's see.

1385
01:04:50,329 --> 01:04:52,189
你们中有80％说的是先进先出。
80% of you said first in, first out.

1386
01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:52,777
布莱恩？
Brian?

1387
01:04:52,777 --> 01:04:53,860
布莱恩·于：是的。
BRIAN YU: That is correct.

1388
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:56,090
那就是我们用来形容的
And that was what we were using to describe

1389
01:04:56,090 --> 01:04:58,490
所谓的队列，队列中的第一件事
what would be called like a queue, where the first thing in the queue

1390
01:04:58,489 --> 01:05:00,447
是队列中的第一件事。
is the first thing that comes out of the queue.

1391
01:05:00,447 --> 01:05:02,442
因此，它遵循FIFO顺序。
So it obeys that FIFO ordering.

1392
01:05:02,443 --> 01:05:04,610
大卫·马兰（David MALAN）：的确，让我们在这里查看排行榜。
DAVID MALAN: Indeed, let's see the leaderboard here.

1393
01:05:04,610 --> 01:05:07,880
好吧，我们有大约8,000辆，但在7,000辆范围内还有更多。
All right, we have some 8,000s, but more in the 7,000 range.

1394
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:09,860
接下来是一个更丰富多彩的问题。
Next up is a more colorful question.

1395
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:13,760
以下哪一项将使用RGB值表示粉红色？
Which of the following would represent pink using RGB values?

1396
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,980
我会让您自己阅读这些内容。
And I'll let you read these on your own.

1397
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:19,730
当然，现在在幕后发生了一些谷歌搜索。
And surely, there's some Googling happening behind the scenes now.

1398
01:05:19,730 --> 01:05:21,050
但是没关系。
But that's OK.

1399
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:22,430
实际上，谷歌非常聪明。
In fact, Google is pretty smart.

1400
01:05:22,429 --> 01:05:24,859
如果您输入一个十六进制代码，它甚至可能
If you type in a hexadecimal code, it might even

1401
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:28,017
告诉您一些色轮或色板。
show you a little color wheel or swatch.

1402
01:05:28,016 --> 01:05:29,849
好吧，让我们看一下结果。
All right, let's take a look at the results.

1403
01:05:29,849 --> 01:05:33,589
似乎您中有55％的人说ffd0e0。
Looks like 55% of you said ffd0e0.

1404
01:05:33,590 --> 01:05:34,370
布莱恩？
Brian?

1405
01:05:34,369 --> 01:05:35,669
布莱恩·于：那是正确的。
BRIAN YU: And that is correct.

1406
01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:38,450
所以这些RGB值就像六个不同的值，
So those RGB values are like six different values,

1407
01:05:38,449 --> 01:05:42,437
其中每两个对应一种颜色，两个对应红色，两个对应绿色，
where each two correspond to one color, two for red, two for green,

1408
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:42,980
两个为蓝色。
two for blue.

1409
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:44,300
全部为十六进制。
This is all in hexadecimal.

1410
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:46,668
而且粉红色每个都会很多。
And pink would be a lot of each of them.

1411
01:05:46,668 --> 01:05:48,710
因为它非常接近白色，就像
Because it's very close to white, which is, like,

1412
01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:50,360
全红，全绿，全蓝。
all red, all green, and all blue.

1413
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:52,740
但是它比绿色和蓝色更红。
But it's more red than it is green and blue.

1414
01:05:52,739 --> 01:05:58,129
这样ffd0e0就是很多红色，绿色少了一点，
And so that one, ffd0e0, is a lot of red, a little bit less green,

1415
01:05:58,130 --> 01:05:59,460
少一点蓝色。
and a little bit less blue.

1416
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:00,080
戴维·马兰（David MALAN）：的确如此。
DAVID MALAN: Indeed.

1417
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:01,787
好吧，让我们看看我们在这里的位置。
All right, let's see where we're at here.

1418
01:06:01,788 --> 01:06:03,560
我们现在要做的-有趣。
We're now up to-- interesting.

1419
01:06:03,559 --> 01:06:05,299
没有人再有完美的分数了。
No one has a perfect score anymore.

1420
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:09,800
但是，来宾200仍以9000点的微弱优势遥遥领先。
But guest 200 is still in the lead with just shy of 9,000 points.

1421
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:12,330
在C中，以下哪几行代码分配
In C, which of the following lines of code allocates

1422
01:06:12,329 --> 01:06:17,089
足够的内存来存储字符串s的副本？
enough memory for a copy of the string s?

1423
01:06:17,090 --> 01:06:19,160
我会让你读这些。
I'll let you read these.

1424
01:06:19,159 --> 01:06:21,679
在C中，以下哪几行代码分配
In C, which of the following lines of code allocates

1425
01:06:21,679 --> 01:06:25,969
足够的内存来存储字符串s的副本？
enough memory for a copy of the string s?

1426
01:06:25,969 --> 01:06:28,249
似乎这里有很多可行的选择。
Bunch of viable choices here, it would seem.

1427
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:31,129
时间，让我们看一下结果。
And time, let's take a look at the results.

1428
01:06:31,130 --> 01:06:34,880
看起来有46％的人说过大小为s的malloc。
Looks like 46% said malloc of size s.

1429
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:39,110
但是33％的布莱恩说s的strlen的malloc加1。
But Brian, 33% said malloc of strlen of s plus 1.

1430
01:06:39,110 --> 01:06:40,490
谁是对的？
Who is right?

1431
01:06:40,489 --> 01:06:43,609
布莱恩·于：在这种情况下，少数族裔在这里是33％是正确的。
BRIAN YU: And in this case, the minority, the 33% are correct here.

1432
01:06:43,610 --> 01:06:46,940
记住，Malloc将内存的字节数作为其参数
Malloc, remember, takes as its argument the number of bytes of memory

1433
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:48,080
您要分配的。
that you want to allocate.

1434
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:50,849
如果您有一个字符串，并且想弄清楚需要多少个字节，
And if you have a string and you want to figure out how many bytes you need,

1435
01:06:50,849 --> 01:06:52,599
你需要知道的第一件事是弄清楚
first thing you need to know is figure out

1436
01:06:52,599 --> 01:06:54,679
那弦多久。很高兴会告诉你
how long is that string. strlen will tell you

1437
01:06:54,679 --> 01:06:56,689
该字符串中有多少个字符。
how many characters are in that string.

1438
01:06:56,690 --> 01:07:00,050
但是您确实需要一个额外的字节，因为在每个字符串的末尾，
But you do need one additional byte, because at the end of every string,

1439
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:01,880
我们有一个空终止符。
we have that null terminating character.

1440
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:03,680
为此，我们需要一个字节的内存。
And we need one byte of memory for that.

1441
01:07:03,679 --> 01:07:07,039
因此，str的slen将为您提供字符串的长度加1。
So strlen of s will give you the length of the string plus 1.

1442
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:09,169
那就是您需要多少字节的内存。
That's how many bytes you need for memory.

1443
01:07:09,170 --> 01:07:09,590
戴维·马兰（David MALAN）：的确如此。
DAVID MALAN: Indeed.

1444
01:07:09,590 --> 01:07:11,007
瞧，您免费获得任何东西。
And see, you get nothing for free.

1445
01:07:11,007 --> 01:07:12,830
您想要做的任何事情都需要自己做。
Anything you want you need to do yourself.

1446
01:07:12,829 --> 01:07:15,739
实际上，加号1是您要解决的问题。
And indeed, the plus 1 is a problem for you to solve.

1447
01:07:15,739 --> 01:07:19,579
现在的发行，访客200仍然领先
The distribution now, guest 200 still in the lead with just

1448
01:07:19,579 --> 01:07:20,899
低于10,000点。
shy of 10,000 points.

1449
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:22,010
那是问题10。
That was question 10.

1450
01:07:22,010 --> 01:07:23,750
我们在比赛的下半场。
We're in the second half of the game.

1451
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:26,930
您应该如何整理衣服以保持凉爽？
How should you organize your clothes to be cool?

1452
01:07:26,929 --> 01:07:28,099
这是11号。
This is number 11.

1453
01:07:28,099 --> 01:07:32,119
堆栈，队列，字典，二叉树。
Stack, queue, dictionary, binary tree.

1454
01:07:32,119 --> 01:07:35,839
您应该如何整理衣服以保持凉爽？
How should you organize your clothes to be cool?

1455
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:39,830
您可能还记得教过我们的杰克和娄。
You might recall Jack and Lou, who taught us this one.

1456
01:07:39,829 --> 01:07:41,739
剩下两秒钟。
Two seconds remain.

1457
01:07:41,739 --> 01:07:44,999
好像有48％的人说队列，Brian。
And it looks like 48% said queue, Brian.

1458
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,250
布莱恩·于：那是正确的。
BRIAN YU: And that is correct.

1459
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:48,560
因此，从与杰克和娄在一起的视频中
So from that video with Jack and Lou, there

1460
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:50,441
是组织线索的不同方式。
were different ways of organizing the clues.

1461
01:07:50,442 --> 01:07:52,150
但是那段视频的结论是，你
But the conclusion of that video was, you

1462
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:53,830
想把你的衣服排成一排。
want to put your clothes in a queue.

1463
01:07:53,829 --> 01:07:56,289
这样，在处理完一个之后，就将其放在队列的末尾。
So that after you're done with one, you put it at the end of the queue.

1464
01:07:56,289 --> 01:07:59,469
在返回到已经穿过的衣服之前，请先使用其他衣服。
And you use something else before you go back to the one you already wore.

1465
01:07:59,469 --> 01:08:00,069
戴维·马兰（David MALAN）：的确如此。
DAVID MALAN: Indeed.

1466
01:08:00,070 --> 01:08:00,570
好的。
All right.

1467
01:08:00,570 --> 01:08:03,040
现在排行榜上，来宾10打破了10,000。
And the leaderboard now, looks like guest 10 broke 10,000.

1468
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:04,629
但是其他人也是如此。
But so did a bunch of other people.

1469
01:08:04,630 --> 01:08:07,540
下一个问题，什么是细分错误？
Next question, what is a segmentation fault?

1470
01:08:07,539 --> 01:08:10,059
当计算机内存不足时，当我们的程序尝试
When a computer runs out of memory, when our program tries

1471
01:08:10,059 --> 01:08:13,479
当程序尝试访问它的内存时读取空文件
to read an empty file, when a program tries to access memory that it

1472
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:16,620
不应该，当地震发生时。
shouldn't, when an earthquake happens.

1473
01:08:16,619 --> 01:08:19,608
看起来其中许多可能都非常接近。
Looks like a lot of these could be pretty close.

1474
01:08:19,609 --> 01:08:21,260
两秒钟
Two seconds.

1475
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:22,963
让我们看看。
And let's see.

1476
01:08:22,962 --> 01:08:26,129
看起来有80％的人说，当程序尝试访问内存时，不应这样做。
Looks like 80% said when a program tries to access memory that it shouldn't.

1477
01:08:26,130 --> 01:08:26,810
布莱恩？
Brian?

1478
01:08:26,810 --> 01:08:28,160
布莱恩·于：这是正确的答案。
BRIAN YU: That is the correct answer.

1479
01:08:28,159 --> 01:08:30,076
尝试时可能会发生细分错误
Segmentation fault can happen if you're trying

1480
01:08:30,077 --> 01:08:33,790
触摸您不应该访问程序内部的内存。
to touch memory that you're not supposed to have access to inside of a program.

1481
01:08:33,789 --> 01:08:35,539
大卫·马兰（David MALAN）：对于13％的人
DAVID MALAN: And for the 13% of people who

1482
01:08:35,539 --> 01:08:38,926
说，当计算机内存不足时，为什么这里不是答案？
said when a computer runs out of memory, why is that not quite the answer here?

1483
01:08:38,926 --> 01:08:41,009
布莱恩·于：这样计算机可能会耗尽内存。
BRIAN YU: So the computer could run out of memory.

1484
01:08:41,010 --> 01:08:43,640
当您调用malloc时，malloc可能会返回null，
Where when you call malloc, malloc might return null,

1485
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:46,040
因为没有可用的内存来分配。
because there's no available memory to allocate.

1486
01:08:46,039 --> 01:08:48,706
但是只要您对此进行检查，并且我们会尽力鼓励您，
But as long as you check for that, and we try and encourage you,

1487
01:08:48,707 --> 01:08:52,100
每当您分配内存时，都要检查一下您是否返回了该值
whenever you're mallocing memory, to check to see if the value you get back

1488
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:52,760
一片空白。
is null.

1489
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:54,805
这可以帮助您避免这些类型的错误。
That can help you to avoid those types of errors.

1490
01:08:54,805 --> 01:08:56,930
戴维·马兰（DAVID MALAN）：现在让我们看一下董事会。
DAVID MALAN: So let's take a look at the board now.

1491
01:08:56,930 --> 01:08:59,569
11,000位客人200的东西。
11,000 something for guest 200.

1492
01:08:59,569 --> 01:09:01,670
现在让我们继续这个问题。
Let's now proceed with this question.

1493
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:05,689
递归会导致以下哪种类型的溢出
Which of the following types of overflow can result from recursion

1494
01:09:05,689 --> 01:09:07,340
没有基本情况？
without a base case?

1495
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:13,359
堆溢出，整数溢出，堆栈溢出，缓冲区溢出。
Heap overflow, integer overflow, stack overflow, buffer overflow.

1496
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:16,370
确实出现了各种形式的溢出。
And all forms of overflow, indeed, came up.

1497
01:09:16,369 --> 01:09:19,509
当然，其中之一也是受欢迎的网站的名称。
One of them is also, of course, the name of a popular website.

1498
01:09:19,510 --> 01:09:21,580
但是所有这些都是实际的东西。
But all of these are actual things.

1499
01:09:21,579 --> 01:09:23,659
但是哪个是正确的？
But which is correct?

1500
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:25,148
好吧，让我们看看结果。
All right, let's see the results.

1501
01:09:25,149 --> 01:09:29,319
看起来有61％，60％发生了堆栈溢出。
Looks like 61%, 60% went with stack overflow.

1502
01:09:29,319 --> 01:09:29,990
布莱恩？
Brian?

1503
01:09:29,989 --> 01:09:31,239
布莱恩·于：那是正确的。
BRIAN YU: And that is correct.

1504
01:09:31,239 --> 01:09:34,597
每次调用函数时，您最终都会获得一点内存
Every time you call a function, you end up getting a little bit of memory

1505
01:09:34,597 --> 01:09:35,889
在该功能的堆栈上。
on the stack for that function.

1506
01:09:35,890 --> 01:09:38,515
而且，如果您一遍又一遍地递归地调用该函数
And if you keep calling that function recursively over and over

1507
01:09:38,515 --> 01:09:40,960
永不停止，因为没有基本情况，
and never stop, because there's no base case,

1508
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,460
那么您可能会耗尽堆栈空间。
then you can run out of stack space.

1509
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:43,997
我们称之为堆栈溢出。
And we call that a stack overflow.

1510
01:09:43,997 --> 01:09:44,830
戴维·马兰（David MALAN）：的确如此。
DAVID MALAN: Indeed.

1511
01:09:44,829 --> 01:09:46,659
好吧，让我们现在来看排行榜。
All right, let's see the leaderboard now.

1512
01:09:46,659 --> 01:09:48,969
来宾200人，仍然是要击败的人。
Guest 200, still the one to beat.

1513
01:09:48,970 --> 01:09:52,149
但是来宾216并不太落后。
But guest 216 is not too far behind.

1514
01:09:52,149 --> 01:09:53,020
下一个问题。
Next question.

1515
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:55,630
在Fiftyville镇，名字叫什么
In the town of Fiftyville, what were the names

1516
01:09:55,630 --> 01:09:59,680
目睹橡皮鸭抢劫案的三个人中有谁？
of the three people who witnessed the rubber duck robbery?

1517
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:01,720
我会让你读这些。
I'll let you read these.

1518
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:04,660
在Fiftyville镇，这三个人的名字是什么
In the town of Fiftyville, what were the names of the three people

1519
01:10:04,659 --> 01:10:06,429
目睹了橡皮鸭抢劫案。
who witnessed the rubber duck robbery.

1520
01:10:06,430 --> 01:10:10,810
今年出现了一个新问题，回想起他完全从IDE中消失了
A new problem this year, recall that he disappeared altogether from the IDE

1521
01:10:10,810 --> 01:10:11,770
那个星期。
for that week.

1522
01:10:11,770 --> 01:10:13,540
好吧，让我们看看结果。
All right, let's see the results.

1523
01:10:13,539 --> 01:10:15,459
布莱恩，这个很近。
Brian, this one is close.

1524
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:17,875
33％的人说露丝，尤金和雷蒙德。
33% said Ruth, Eugene, and Raymond.

1525
01:10:17,875 --> 01:10:20,000
布莱恩·于：露丝，尤金和雷蒙德是正确的。
BRIAN YU: And Ruth, Eugene, and Raymond is correct.

1526
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,083
他们得到的回应比其他任何人都多。
They've got more responses than any of the others.

1527
01:10:22,082 --> 01:10:22,929
这很棘手。
It was tricky.

1528
01:10:22,930 --> 01:10:24,430
但是，是的，这是正确的答案。
But yeah, that's the correct answer.

1529
01:10:24,430 --> 01:10:26,500
名称背后没有太多理由。
There wasn't a whole lot of reason behind the names.

1530
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:28,300
我对这个故事本身做了很多思考。
I put a lot of thought into the story itself.

1531
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:29,500
但是对名称并没有太多的想法。
But not a lot of thought to the names.

1532
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:31,629
这些只是随机选择的。
Those were kind of just randomly selected.

1533
01:10:31,630 --> 01:10:33,767
但这只是证人的名字。
But those were the names of the witnesses.

1534
01:10:33,766 --> 01:10:34,599
戴维·马兰（David MALAN）：的确如此。
DAVID MALAN: Indeed.

1535
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:38,380
而现在的排行榜上，我们还有200位来宾被击败。
And the leaderboard now, we still have guest 200 is the one to beat.

1536
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:39,530
这是问题15。
This is question 15.

1537
01:10:39,529 --> 01:10:42,279
因此，我们快结束了，仍然有机会继续前进。
So we are nearing the end, still chance to pull ahead.

1538
01:10:42,279 --> 01:10:46,179
以下哪个命令行程序检查您的代码是否存在内存泄漏？
Which of these command line programs checks your code for memory leaks?

1539
01:10:46,180 --> 01:10:50,110
Valgrind，clang，mkdir，make。
Valgrind, clang, mkdir, make.

1540
01:10:50,109 --> 01:10:53,859
请注意，这些都没有50，这意味着它们都是真实世界
Notice that none of these have 50 on it, which means these are all real world

1541
01:10:53,859 --> 01:10:56,949
您将继续在自己的Mac或PC上看到的命令
commands that you would continue to see on your own Mac or PC

1542
01:10:56,949 --> 01:10:59,799
或某些将来的Linux系统。
or some future Linux system.

1543
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:02,380
让我们看看结果。
And let's see the results.

1544
01:11:02,380 --> 01:11:05,020
在这里，瓦尔格朗德是最明显的赢家，占78％。
Here we have valgrind, the clear winner, 78%.

1545
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:05,560
布莱恩？
Brian?

1546
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:06,760
布莱恩·于：那是正确的答案。
BRIAN YU: And that's the correct answer.

1547
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:09,302
那是您可以用来检查程序的程序
That's the program you can use in order to check your program

1548
01:11:09,301 --> 01:11:11,379
看看是否有内存泄漏，看看
to see if you have any memory leaks, to see

1549
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:14,890
如果您要触摸内存，那您就不应该，如果您忘记释放某些东西。
if you're touching memory you shouldn't, if you're forgetting to free something.

1550
01:11:14,890 --> 01:11:16,100
Valgrind对于所有这些都很有用。
Valgrind is useful for all of that.

1551
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:19,030
戴维·马兰（DAVID MALAN）：如果可以的话，我觉得你们中有5％的人现在正与我们混为一谈。
DAVID MALAN: And if I may, I feel like 5% of you are just messing with us now.

1552
01:11:19,029 --> 01:11:20,319
希望如此，但我们会看到的。
Hopefully, but we shall see.

1553
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:22,299
好的，最后五个问题。
All right, last five questions to go.

1554
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:26,210
现在查看排行榜之后，访客200仍然位于顶部。
After taking a look at the leaderboard now, guest 200's still up at the top.

1555
01:11:26,210 --> 01:11:30,130
以下哪项在C中存在，但在Python中不存在。
Which of the following exists in C, but not Python.

1556
01:11:30,130 --> 01:11:32,800
布尔表达式，do-while循环，递归
Boolean expressions, do-while loops, recursive

1557
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:35,740
函数，浮点数。
functions, floating-point numbers.

1558
01:11:35,739 --> 01:11:40,449
C中存在以下哪项，但Python中不存在？
Which of the following exists in C, but not Python?

1559
01:11:40,449 --> 01:11:44,739
两种语言之间有趣的比较，超出了语法。
An interesting comparison between two languages that goes beyond syntax.

1560
01:11:44,739 --> 01:11:45,579
好的。
All right.

1561
01:11:45,579 --> 01:11:46,329
时间到。
Time's up.

1562
01:11:46,329 --> 01:11:47,589
让我们来看看。
Let's take a look.

1563
01:11:47,590 --> 01:11:50,380
看起来68％的用户使用了do-while循环。
Looks like 68% went with do-while loops.

1564
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:51,160
布莱恩？
Brian?

1565
01:11:51,159 --> 01:11:52,359
布莱恩·于：是的。
BRIAN YU: That is correct.

1566
01:11:52,359 --> 01:11:53,559
Python具有for循环。
Python has for loops.

1567
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:54,910
Python具有while循环。
Python has while loops.

1568
01:11:54,909 --> 01:11:57,729
但是它没有C所具有的do-while循环。
But it doesn't have do-while loops in the same way that C does.

1569
01:11:57,729 --> 01:12:00,189
您必须找到其他方法来尝试实现
You'd have to find some other way of trying to achieve

1570
01:12:00,189 --> 01:12:01,809
同样的逻辑想法。
that same kind of logical idea.

1571
01:12:01,810 --> 01:12:02,200
戴维·马兰（David MALAN）：的确如此。
DAVID MALAN: Indeed.

1572
01:12:02,199 --> 01:12:04,407
布赖恩，当我们
And Brian, what was the approach that we took when we

1573
01:12:04,408 --> 01:12:06,010
试图在几周前重新创建？
tried to recreate that some weeks ago?

1574
01:12:06,010 --> 01:12:06,250
布莱恩·于：是的。
BRIAN YU: Yeah.

1575
01:12:06,250 --> 01:12:09,069
因此，一种解决方法是无限循环，尽管如此，
So one approach to it is having an infinite loop, while true,

1576
01:12:09,069 --> 01:12:10,779
这只会一直重复。
that will just always repeat.

1577
01:12:10,779 --> 01:12:13,719
然后，当您到达可以退出循环的位置时，
And then when you reach a point where you can exit the loop,

1578
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:16,000
您可以使用命令中断来跳出循环
you can use the command break to get out of the loop

1579
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,627
并继续执行该程序的其余部分。
and move on to the rest of the program.

1580
01:12:17,627 --> 01:12:18,460
戴维·马兰（David MALAN）：的确如此。
DAVID MALAN: Indeed.

1581
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:20,210
好吧，让我们看一下董事会。
All right, let's take a look at the board.

1582
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:25,810
来宾200仍为15938，但仍落后几个亲密朋友。
Guest 200 still now at 15,938, but still a few close folks behind.

1583
01:12:25,810 --> 01:12:30,310
发送私人信息时应使用哪种HTTP请求方法
What HTTP request method should you use when sending private information

1584
01:12:30,310 --> 01:12:31,600
像密码一样？
like a password?

1585
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:35,200
GET，POST，SELECT还是TEXT？
GET, POST, SELECT, or TEXT?

1586
01:12:35,199 --> 01:12:37,899
发送时应使用哪种HTTP请求方法
Which HTTP request method should use when sending

1587
01:12:37,899 --> 01:12:41,859
私人信息（例如密码）？
private information like a password?

1588
01:12:41,859 --> 01:12:43,509
看一下结果。
Take a look at the results.

1589
01:12:43,510 --> 01:12:44,290
好的。
All right.

1590
01:12:44,289 --> 01:12:48,547
POST的发布者很多，Brian，74％
And the distribution is a lot of people said POST, Brian, 74%

1591
01:12:48,547 --> 01:12:49,839
布莱恩·于：他们是正确的。
BRIAN YU: And they are correct.

1592
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:52,007
是的，如果这是一个获取请求，那么您最终会
Yeah, if it was a get request, then you would end up

1593
01:12:52,006 --> 01:12:54,789
网址中可能包含敏感信息
with sensitive information inside the URL that might show up

1594
01:12:54,789 --> 01:12:56,694
例如，在您的浏览历史记录中。
in your browsing history, for example.

1595
01:12:56,694 --> 01:12:59,599
为了安全起见，您需要确保使用POST请求
So to be secure, you want to be sure to use the POST request

1596
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:00,850
这种类型的东西的方法。
method for that type of stuff.

1597
01:13:00,850 --> 01:13:02,410
戴维·马兰（David MALAN）：明确一点，请不要这样做。
DAVID MALAN: And to be clear, don't do this.

1598
01:13:02,409 --> 01:13:04,309
获取是可能的，我们看到了如何做到这一点。
Get is possible, and we saw how to do that.

1599
01:13:04,310 --> 01:13:07,420
但是，当然那会在您的历史记录和其他暴露的地方结束。
But of course, that then ends up in your history and other exposed places.

1600
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:10,550
SELECT和TEXT不是HTTP动词。
SELECT and TEXT were not HTTP verbs.

1601
01:13:10,550 --> 01:13:12,010
因此POST确实可以实现。
So POST is indeed spot on.

1602
01:13:12,010 --> 01:13:14,140
好的，只剩下三个问题。
All right, only three questions remain.

1603
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:17,830
来宾200仍然是被击败的人，其次是来宾216。
Guest 200 is still the one to beat, followed by guest 216.

1604
01:13:17,829 --> 01:13:22,869
什么数据结构允许恒定时间查找字典中的单词？
What data structure allows for constant time look up for words in a dictionary?

1605
01:13:22,869 --> 01:13:28,329
链表，二进制搜索树，数组还是特里？
A linked list, a binary search tree, an array, or a trie?

1606
01:13:28,329 --> 01:13:30,729
回想一下字典是一个抽象数据
Recall that a dictionary was an abstract data

1607
01:13:30,729 --> 01:13:33,879
类型，只要您可以以不同的方式实现它即可。
type, insofar as you could implement it in different ways.

1608
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:37,000
但是要获取恒定的时间，您可能需要
But to get constant time look up, you might want

1609
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,779
在其中之一上使用其中之一。
to use one of these over the others.

1610
01:13:40,779 --> 01:13:42,569
让我们看看结果。
Let's see the results.

1611
01:13:42,569 --> 01:13:43,799
有趣的。
Interesting.

1612
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:45,870
布赖恩，有32％的人说特里。
Brian, 32% said trie.

1613
01:13:45,869 --> 01:13:47,009
您能在这里帮助我们吗？
Can you help us out here?

1614
01:13:47,010 --> 01:13:47,310
布莱恩·于：是的。
BRIAN YU: Yeah.

1615
01:13:47,310 --> 01:13:48,602
特里是正确的答案。
The trie is the correct answer.

1616
01:13:48,601 --> 01:13:52,019
对于其他所有链接列表，二进制搜索树和数组，
For all of the others, the linked list, the binary search tree, and the array,

1617
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:54,220
随着字典中越来越多的单词，
as you have more and more words in the dictionary,

1618
01:13:54,220 --> 01:13:56,580
找到一个单词将花费越来越长的时间，
it's going to take longer and longer to find a word,

1619
01:13:56,579 --> 01:13:58,649
因为您必须通过它进行线性搜索
as you have to either linear search through it

1620
01:13:58,649 --> 01:14:02,339
否则您必须遍历二叉搜索树中的各个节点。
or you have to go down through various nodes in the binary search tree.

1621
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:05,580
另一方面，特里仅取决于单词的长度
The trie on the other hand, it only depends upon the length of the word

1622
01:14:05,579 --> 01:14:06,539
您正在查找。
that you're looking up.

1623
01:14:06,539 --> 01:14:08,969
词典中有多少个单词都没有关系。
It doesn't matter how many words are in the dictionary.

1624
01:14:08,970 --> 01:14:12,090
您只需在要查找的单词中的每个字母后面跟随一个节点。
You just follow one node for each letter in the word you're looking up.

1625
01:14:12,090 --> 01:14:14,490
而且您会在恒定时间内找到该单词。
And you'll find that word in constant time.

1626
01:14:14,489 --> 01:14:17,439
大卫·马兰（David MALAN）：布赖恩（Brian），如果持续时间不变，那么1的大O值是如此之好，
DAVID MALAN: And Brian, if constant time, Big O of 1 is so good,

1627
01:14:17,439 --> 01:14:19,106
那么，为什么不对所有内容都使用尝试呢？
why not use tries, then, for everything?

1628
01:14:19,106 --> 01:14:21,272
布莱恩·于：嗯，一切都有取舍。
BRIAN YU: Well, there are trade offs for everything.

1629
01:14:21,273 --> 01:14:23,640
尝试可为您提供理论上恒定的时间。
The trie gives you theoretically constant time.

1630
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:25,440
但是最大的折衷之一是记忆力。
But one of the big trade offs is memory.

1631
01:14:25,439 --> 01:14:27,569
尝试最终使用更多的内存来
That tries end up using much more memory to be

1632
01:14:27,569 --> 01:14:31,296
能够比许多其他数据结构存储字典。
able to store a dictionary than many of those other data structures would.

1633
01:14:31,296 --> 01:14:32,129
戴维·马兰（David MALAN）：的确如此。
DAVID MALAN: Indeed.

1634
01:14:32,130 --> 01:14:33,450
让我们看一下结果。
Let's look at the results.

1635
01:14:33,449 --> 01:14:35,399
和来宾200仍然处于领先地位。
And guest 200 still at the lead.

1636
01:14:35,399 --> 01:14:38,309
但是，来宾752现在正踩在他们的脚跟上。
But guest 752 is now nipping at their heels.

1637
01:14:38,310 --> 01:14:40,500
最后两个问题。
We have two final questions.

1638
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:42,899
速度又很重要。
And speed, again, does matter.

1639
01:14:42,899 --> 01:14:44,979
什么是Cookie？
What is a cookie?

1640
01:14:44,979 --> 01:14:48,729
用于在网站上识别您的计算机的数据，美味小吃，
Data used to identify your computer to websites, a delicious snack,

1641
01:14:48,729 --> 01:14:53,139
